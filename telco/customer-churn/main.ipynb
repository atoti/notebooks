    "# Understanding Telco Customer Churn\n",
    "\n",
    "### A few definitions\n",
    "- [Customer attrition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_attrition#:~:text=Customer%20attrition%2C%20also%20known%20as,loss%20of%20clients%20or%20customers.&text=Gross%20attrition%20is%20the%20loss,services%20during%20a%20particular%20period.), also known as customer churn is the loss of customers or subscription to goods/services by a business\n",
    "For a given period of time:\n",
    "- Customer attrition rate is the number of customers lost at the end of the period against the number of customers the business had at the start of the period. \n",
    "- Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their recurring revenue for contracted goods or services during the period\n",
    "- Net attrition is the loss of customers while factoring the gain of new customers within the same group and location\n",
    "- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) is the recurring revenue expected on monthly basis for the subscribed goods/services\n",
    "- Net Revenue Retention (NRR) measures the change in the MRR over the period (includes benefits from expansion)\n",
    "- Gross Revenue Retention (GRR) measures annual revenue lost from the business' existing customer base (excludes benefits from expansion)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Churn is a critical metric for subscription and SaaS companies as it tells us how the departing customers affects the company's monthly revenue and growth, consequently investors' confidence in the company as well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The GRR is somewhat like a happiness indicator for the existing customers. Having high GRR shows that the company has high retention rates. Customers are happy with the services/products that they are provided with. Investors would be assured by this stability.  \n",
    "If a company has high GRR and even higher NRR, it shows that on top of retaining existing customers, the company has grown its customer base further.  \n",
    "High NRR coupled with low GRR implies that although the company has acquired many new customers, it has low retention rates.  \n",
    "So even if there is still revenue left over after the churn, there is high potential the new customers might churn too. The growth of the company becomes less predictable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Telecommunication industry is highly sensitive to customer churns as technology advances and users' behaviour changed:\n",
    "- with Mobile Number Portability (MNP), customers can easily switch to another provider while preserving their number\n",
    "- OTT players such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+ are bypassing the traditional operators network such as cable, broadcast and satelite television\n",
    "- OTT applications such as WhatsApp, Google Hangout, Skype are cannibalizing the paid voice and messaging services\n",
    "- customers are less enticed to be contract bounded for handsets as new models get released so frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at the customer churn in the telecommunication sector.  \n",
    "Using the [Telco Customer Churn from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), we explore the accuracy of 4 machine learning algorithms against the actual churn in the past month:  \n",
    "- Logistic Regression Prediction\n",
    "- Logistic Regression (SMOTE) Prediction\n",
    "- Naive Bayes Prediction\n",
    "- SVM Classifier Linear Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: we train the models with last month's churn data using the algorithm provided in [Telecom Customer Churn Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/pavanraj159/telecom-customer-churn-prediction).  \n",
    "We compare the model's prediction against the same set of data for accuracy comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that we wish to retain 90% NRR for this particular telco, we will explore with atoti the impact of each model on:\n",
    "- Predicted revenue loss\n",
    "- Number of customers to retain\n",
    "- Expense spent to retain or replace customer\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we use what-if simulation to see how the above will change when we change:\n",
    "- the target NRR\n",
    "- the budget spent on customer retention or replacement"
