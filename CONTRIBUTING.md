We welcome any contributions from the community. 

## Getting started

To get started, please proceed to 

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the atoti repository:

<img src="assets/fork_atoti_repo.png">

2. Pull the `main` branch (`git checkout main` and `git pull`) from the forked repository.
3. Run `poetry install` to be sure to work with the expected dependencies.
4. Create a working branch `git switch -c <PSEUDO>/<SUBJECT>`.
5. Start JupyterLab: `poetry run jupyter lab`.
6. Create the folder and notebooks.
    Add notebooks responsible for data pre-processing to the [list of untested notebooks](tests/execute_notebooks.py).
    The main notebook using atoti should be tested to ensure users can run it.
7. If a dependency is missing run `poetry add <DEPENDENCY_NAME>`: **DEPENDENCIES MUST NOT BEEN ADDED WITH CONDA OR PIP** since the Github CI relies on the `poetry.lock` file to install dependencies.
8. Commit and push changes to the forked repository using `git push`.
9. Create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from the forked repository. 

Please monitor the pull request as each pull request is subject to automatic code testing. The atoti team will review and comment on any pull requests to ensure each submission is aligned with the API's usage.


## Pull Request Rules
Please make sure your PR follows the rules below:

### General notebook rules

- folders and files name should be lowercase with hyphen.

  Example: `name-of-my-folder-or-file`

  Example: `/relevant-domain/title-of-my-notebook-folder/`

- entrypoint should be named `main.ipynb`
- README TOC should be updated to link to the new notebook
- notebook should have an H1 title, matching folder name and README TOC
- create a README at notebook level to briefly introduce yourself and the use case.

### Data rules

- data files name should use snake_case
- data files should be of reasonnable size, not exceeding 50MB, unless programmatically generated
- all data files should be uploaded on data.atoti.io If you don't have access to it, data should be hosted on a public host and an owner will transfer them to data.atoti.io upon review

### Python code rules
