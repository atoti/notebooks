I noticed that you guys aren't really talking about the matter at hand in the world today: Corona. All this time I've spent in this subreddit I thought that I missed out on hitting big, but now that I've learned to take advantage at the matter at hand, I feel like I've finally found something useful to be here for. When the COVID vaccine comes out, It's going to be a HUGE deal, and I was thinking that maybe we should take a look at Pfizer (PFE), Biontech (BNTX), Moderna (MRNA), and/or AstraZeneca (AZN), the leaders in the race for the vaccine, so we can see them as an opportunity for this subreddit and its future. They have done the most testing for the vaccine and there is a possibility that one of them may release it first, and when that happens, millions of people will go get vaccinated around the world. Again, this is a big deal, because it means that we finally won't have to worry about dying from Corona anymore, and we can return to life like it was pre-2020. This vaccine could be the ticket to full economic recovery and the liberation of millions from our houses and back on the streets.\r\n\r\nNow I'm going to tell you what to do when it comes out: if your money is in a company other than the one that released the vaccine first, immediately, and I mean IMMEDIATELY, sell it and put the money into the other company so you don't lose much. The companies that didn't make it first will plummet due to reduced demand.\r\n\r\nAlso note that I'm not recommending the Chinese companies because, you know, they could be used to influence us."

              "“-Today, we reveal why we believe Nikola is an intricate fraud built on dozens of lies over the course of its Founder and Executive Chairman Trevor Milton’s career.\r\n\r\n-We have gathered extensive evidence—including recorded phone calls, text messages, private emails and behind-the-scenes photographs—detailing dozens of false statements by Nikola Founder Trevor Milton. We have never seen this level of deception at a public company, especially of this size.\r\n\r\n-Trevor has managed to parlay these false statements made over the course of a decade into a ~$20 billion public company. He has inked partnerships with some of the top auto companies in the world, all desperate to catch up to Tesla and to harness the EV wave.\r\nWe examine how Nikola got its early start and show how Trevor misled partners into signing agreements by falsely claiming to have extensive proprietary technology.\r\n\r\n-We reveal how, in the face of growing skepticism over the functionality of its truck, Nikola staged a video called “Nikola One in Motion” which showed the semi-truck cruising on a road at a high rate of speed. Our investigation of the site and text messages from a former employee reveal that the video was an elaborate ruse—Nikola had the truck towed to the top of a hill on a remote stretch of road and simply filmed it rolling down the hill.\r\n\r\n-In October 2019, Nikola announced it would revolutionize the battery industry. This was to be done through a pending acquisition, but the deal fell through when Nikola realized (a) the technology was vaporware and (b) the President of the battery company had been indicted months earlier over allegations that he conned NASA by using his expense account to procure numerous prostitutes.\r\n\r\n-Nikola has never walked back claims relating to its battery technology. Instead, Trevor continued to publicly hype the technology even after becoming aware of the above issues. The revolutionary battery technology never existed – now, Nikola plans to use GM’s battery technology instead.\r\n\r\n-A spokesman for Volvo spin-off Powercell AB, a hydrogen fuel cell technology company that formerly partnered with Nikola, called Nikola’s battery and hydrogen fuel cell claims “hot air”.\r\n\r\n-In addition to now using GM’s battery technology, Nikola seeks to use the automaker’s production and fuel cell capabilities. Nikola seems to be bringing nothing to the partnership but concept designs, their brand name and up to $700 million they will be paying GM for costs related to production.\r\n\r\n-Inexpensive hydrogen is fundamental to the success of Nikola’s business model. Trevor has claimed in a presentation to hundreds of people and in multiple interviews to have succeeded at cutting the cost of hydrogen by ~81% compared to peers and to already be producing hydrogen. Nikola has not produced hydrogen at this price or at any price as he later admitted when pressed by media.\r\n\r\n-Trevor has appointed his brother, Travis, as “Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure” to oversee this critical part of the business. Travis’s prior experience looks to have largely consisted of pouring concrete driveways and doing subcontractor work on home renovations in Hawaii.\r\n\r\n-Claims of owning energy producing assets is not new for Nikola. Trevor claimed that Nikola’s headquarters has 3.5 megawatts of solar panels on its roof producing energy. Aerial photos of the roof and later media reports show that the supposed panels don’t exist.\r\n\r\n-At one point Nikola claimed to own its own natural gas wells. There is no evidence in company filings to support this. The claims were eventually quietly removed from Nikola’s website.\r\n\r\n-Trevor claims Nikola designs all key components in house, but they appear to simply be buying or licensing them from third-parties. One example: we found that Nikola actually buys inverters from a company called Cascadia. In a video showing off its “in-house” inverters, Nikola concealed the Cascadia label with a piece of masking tape.\r\n\r\n-In a July 2020 podcast, Trevor said of Nikola’s “Tre” truck: “We have five of them coming off the assembly line right now in Ulm Germany.” A spokesperson for Bosch, the manufacturing partner building the trucks, confirmed this month that they haven’t made any trucks yet.\r\n\r\n-The company’s Nikola One “reveal” was a total farce. We corroborate Bloomberg’s earlier work debunking Trevor’s claims regarding its semi-truck that “this thing fully functions and works…this is a real truck” and provide new evidence.\r\n\r\n-We present behind-the-scenes photos showing that Nikola had an electricity cable snaked up from underneath the stage into the truck in order to falsely claim the Nikola One’s electrical systems fully functioned.\r\n\r\n-We learned through emails and interviews with former partners that Trevor had an artist stencil “H2” and “Zero Emission Hydrogen Electric” on the side of the Nikola One despite it having no hydrogen capabilities whatsoever; it was built with natural gas components.\r\n\r\n-We also present evidence that subsequent “reveals” were fictitious. In 2019, Nikola revealed a “next generation” version of its off-road vehicle. We learned that it was scrapped within weeks of the unveiling due to manufacturing challenges. The redesign work was then quietly outsourced.\r\n\r\n-Nikola’s much-touted multi-billion dollar order book is filled with fluff. U.S. Xpress reportedly accounts for a third of its reservations, representing ~$3.5 billion in orders. U.S. Xpress had only $1.3 million in cash on hand last quarter.\r\n\r\n-Nikola’s key partners and backers have been cashing out aggressively. Worthington, Bosch and ValueAct have all sold shares. Worthington sold $237 million shares over a 2-day span in July and another $250 million in August. We think they know exactly what type of company Nikola is, and we expect that as Nikola’s GM “partnership” boosts the stock price, key holders will continue to exit.\r\n\r\n-We think Trevor Milton, through dozens of outright lies, was able to form partnerships with some of the largest legacy auto companies in the world in their desperation to catch up to Tesla’s EV leadership status.\r\n\r\n-Trevor has ensured he is not going down with the ship.  He cashed out $70 million around the IPO and amended his share lock-up from 1-year to 180 days.

Again, unemployment payments and less than anticipated unemployment numbers means less defaults than anticipated.\r\n\r\n[The media was calling gloom and doom at the start of US shutdowns and we know that things are a lot different now](https://news.bloombergtax.com/financial-accounting/four-megabanks-33-billion-loan-loss-warning-sets-off-confusion)\r\n\r\n\r\n[How it is now](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-etf-could-finally-beckoning-163229212.html)\r\n\r\nIf these can be rolled into excess cash, the EPS will be significatly higher for coming earnings.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe fed:\r\n\r\nFeds probably wont announce anything too out of the ordinary.\r\n\r\nAgain, 0% rates are priced in at this point. Financials have been flat for a while.\r\n\r\nThey will probably call for another round of stimulus from congress.\r\n\r\nWorst case: they declare world war 3 against Florida and new world currency is oranges going into flu season.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome catalysts into this weekend and next week:\r\n\r\n[Citigroup is getting into the press cycle for naming the first ever female CEO in financial banking](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/business/citigroup-ceo-jane-fraser.html)\r\n\r\n[PNC Bank just got upgraded from hold to buy by Odeon](https://markets.businessinsider.com/analysts-opinions/pnc-financial-services-group-inc--buy-730156)\r\n\r\n[JPM just started a trading team for stocks on private companies like Space X and pre ipo companies like Robinhood and AirBNB](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/jpmorgan-trade-private-shares-of-mega-start-ups-including-spacex-robinhood-and-airbnb.html)\r\n\r\n[With that being said screw Wells Fargo even if they got an upgrade from sell to hold by UBS](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/wells-fargos-stock-gains-after-ubs-backs-away-from-bearish-view-2020-09-11)\r\n\r\n\r\nI still think Commercial Retail Real Estate bag holders are screwed going into 2021.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTLDR:\r\n\r\n*0% rates until 2022 priced in.\r\n\r\n*Banks have been building cash reserves for loans going bust, but the data they were working on was gloom and doom. Excess cash can potentially be rolled into upcoming earnings.\r\n\r\n*Staying relatively green while spy dipped Friday.\r\n\r\n*Lots of catalysts going into the weekend and next week.\r\n\r\n*Tech correcting and investors rotating into value stocks.\r\n\r\n[Further reading, numbers, and charts](https://www.barrons.com/articles/bank-stocks-outlook-recovery-coronavirus-rebound-51599757540)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyone else think this could be the turning point for financials?\r\n\r\nThoughts on these: JPM, GS, MS, BAC, ~~WFC~~, XLF, FAS?\r\n\r\nPersonally holding:\r\n28 JPM 100c 9/18\r\nJPM 102c 9/18\r\n\r\nI'm probably losing $5000 this week but at the same time no one is talking about this so it would be neat to have a 3-4% green week on these tickers."

              "\\>Listen up retards, I want you to start making legitimate low risk guaranteed returns. This strategy if done correctly is actually the most profitable theta strategy, and the only one that can generate more then 70% if your investment consistently every month.    \r\n\r\n\\>Quick Steps on how to do it and the TLDR is at the end, although i recommend reading through my explanation    \r\n\r\n\\>Ok if you’re still reading we’ll need to establish a few things. A covered call is when you own 100 shares of a stock, and you sell a call against your position.     \r\n\r\n\\>So basically if I own 100 shares of spy right now, I can sell a call at 335 giving the right to the buyer of the call to buy my 100 shares at 335 each, in exchange they will give me a premium to have that right, and hence I make money. This strategy works when you’re expecting the stock to be bearish or flat. However, if the call exercises when it is ITM, you will be forced to sell 100 shares of spy at 335 no matter what the price is.    \r\n\r\n\\>Now a poor man's covered call uses the same strategy, however using a different collateral. You see, when you buy a call, you are buying the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying at an agreed upon price. Therefore lets take this example, I buy a 335 call on spy, if I exercise it, I can buy a 100 shares of spy for 335 each. Now this right gives us incredible leverage, because we are able to do this, at the same time we can sell another call, such a 335 call. Now if the 335 call we sold is ITM and we are forced to exercise, then we exercise the call we bought, buy 100 shares for 335, and sell it to the other guy for 335, then we’re released from all of its obligation. This also applies to call you sell that are at a higher strike price then the one you’re holding, see if you’re forced to exercise, you’ll make the difference in intrinsic value back as profit. Such as selling a call at the 336 strike price, if you’re forced to exercise then you’ll actually make a 100$.     \r\n\r\n\\>Ok you’re with me so far? We have one more strategy to talk about, the diagonal spread. The diagonal spread is a strategy where you buy a long dated call say four months out, and sell another call at a higher strike price and shorter strike price. That way you make money from the premium of the short strike call, while simultaneously making money on the long dated call we bought.     \r\n\r\n\\>So this strategy employs these two strategies together on SPY. So let's get started to how you would set this up. First of all, you’ll go to SPY, and look at the current price. Currently Spy closed at 333.91, so we will use this value for our calculations. Now the usual way to find the best long dated option to buy, is to find one that is very close to being OTM or even a dollar or two ITM. The best date is 4 months plus, because you'll have around two months of negligible theta.      \r\n\r\n\\>An important point here, the further out the better as the less theta, the more money this will generate long term. In addition, the more ITM the call is the better because it gives you more leeway, I’ll explain how to use this to your advantage later.    \r\n\r\n\\>So in our case, the best call to buy, is the 333c Jan 15 2021 for 1943$. Now you buy this, and you’re a proud owner of this call, now it’s time to start selling a call against it. The closest next expiry date is sep 14. Now the 336c call is looking pretty spicey with it’s 123$ premium, so we sell it.    \r\n\r\n\\>Now a very simple plug in of the call you sold into a \\[profit calculator\\]([https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)) we see that for this call to remain over the 123$ worth spy will have to open at 337.50 or higher which is more then 4$ increase, which isn’t always likely. Now let’s go over the few scenarios that might occur:    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\* spy opens below 337.50, in which case the call will lose its value. As long as spy doesn’t close above 336, then you get to keep the premium, and if spy hovers around the current price and up to 334, the call becomes worth less then 20$, which means you can buy it back and get to keep the 100$ + difference    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Spy moons 9 points to 342 in one day. To close the call it would cost you 553$ as it would be worth 675. However, keep in mind that our long dated call is now worth 2397. Therefore, if we closed both options we will be at a total loss of 50$. This happens due to gamma of the short call being higher, due to it's shorter expiry date. If you had cash, you can buy back that call you sold, and lose 553 cash on hand, and be 50$ negative on your entire portfolio. Then you can turn around and sell more calls    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Spy has a retarded correction, or even god forbid a crash. In which case your long dated call will rapidly lose value and if spy loses more then 15% of its value, such as below 280$ then you lose 85% of the value of the spread. On the other a correction of 10%, would make the spread lose 65% of its value    \r\n\r\n\\>>It’s very important to remember, the type of equity that spy represents, which is the entire US market. For context, in the last 5 years, spy has only had 7 instances of a correction over 10% which can result in a heavy loss with this strategy. Now let’s look at the possible actions to take in every scenario.    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If the call has lost more then 80% of its value, or really any amount where your profits are over 120, them buy it back and close it.    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If the call becomes ITM and you’re forced to close it, then look at your options(no pun intended)    \r\n\r\n\\>>>\\*If you have enough cash to close it, and you don’t have any possible use for that available cash within the next two weeks then close it.     \r\n\r\n\\>>>\\*If you don’t have enough money to close the call or you’re not willing to lose that available cash, then simply close both options with either a profit or a loss depending on how had spy mooned that day.        \r\n\r\n\\>Now after you’ve done this once, let’s say you were successful and the call you sold was worth less and you made premium back. Now you have more cash on hand, and you’ve made money. Keep in mind, this also means more leeway, in case the next trade you might have to close the short call at a loss, either available cash loss, or net loss.     \r\n\r\n\\>Doing the math on possible profits. In a single month, you are able to sell 12 spy calls. If a spy remains flat, or has a slow upwards trend, and says on average you sell your calls at a profit of 100$, then you can make 1200$ from the spy, on a 2000$ investment. Every month, until expiry on the long call. If spy rises, then your initial call would also increase in value, resulting in extra profits when you eventually close it.     \r\n\r\n\\>\\_\\_NOW COMPARE THIS TO THE WHEEL STRATEGY\\_\\_ you would need a minimum of 33,000$ in order to buy a 100 shares of spy. Now first of all, the upfront collateral is ridiculous, and not many can afford it. If you’re asking yourself, well why can’t I use a cheaper stock, remember that only a spy has 12 contracts per month, every other etf and stock only has 4 per month. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of spy, it's more reliable in terms of premiums.    \r\n\r\n\\>Here’s the best part too, spy increasing in value won’t benefit you with the wheel strategy, as you’re forced to sell your shares at the strike price of the short call. On the other hand, let’s compare the potential losses with this strategy, If spy were to lose 10% of value down to 300, then you’ll lose 3000$ vs only 1600$ with our long call. In addition, if spy keeps losing value you’ll keep losing money, while your gains are capped with the long call.     \r\n\r\n\\>Thereby the obvious advantages of this strategy:    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*We profit from spy’s increase of value and its flatness        \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Our maximum losses are capped, and the more successful calls we sell the less our risk becomes.        \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Our total needed collateral is a fraction of spy, at usually around 6%. Keep in mind that the same call, 333c at an expiration of sep 17 2021, a leap year call, is only 3000$, which is still only 9% of the value we’d usually need.     \r\n\r\n\\>And the best part, is how scalable this is, at an average of 100$ per contract sold profits, we can make back out entire about a month and a half, and we can buy another long contract. This way, spending 4000$, for an average return of 200$ per contract. This is ofcourse not counting our long dated calls increasing value with spy.     \r\n\r\n\\>This is to make your mouth water at the possible tendies. A 10,000$ investment, which is 5 contracts, can generate 6000$ per month on average, or even higher depending on market conditions. Keep in mind, the same amount of money, the 33,000 needed to use the wheel strategy, can generate 20,000 a month, vs the regular 1200 it can generate.    \r\n\r\n\\>Keep in mind, this only works if spy is in an flat and positive trend. To put things into perspective, it takes 1.5 months to generate enough money to buy a second contract.  Now that you’d be making double the money, that means you’ll need half the time, to get the second contract, and because we’re buying the contract at a higher strike price for the same price of around 2000, we keep covering higher and higher values of spy. So the second contract takes 1.5 months, the second would take three weeks, the third would take a week and half, the fourth would take 2 option dates, and them you’ll be making enough money to buy another call, every weekly option.    \r\n\r\n\\>I’ll make a part 2 about how to take this strategy further if you are successful to layer calls upon calls, virtually building a tranche that becomes very profitable.     \r\n\r\n\\>So I hope you employ this strategy to start making real money, and generating actual returns that are consistent, while still basking in the glory of theta gang, without needing the ridiculous amount of collateral\r\n\r\n\\>TLDR : For the absolute retards who don't want to read but instead want to know positions: you’ll need around 2000 - 2500 $ to employ this strategy correctly        \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Buy long dated spy call, 4+ months out such as 335c Spy Jan 15 2021     \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Then sell calls on weekly spy, 3-5$ OTM     \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If the call you sold becomes ITM, buy it back with the cash on hand, if you can't, close both positions, and re-enter your long position at a higher strike price\r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If not, buy the call back on the expiration day when it's lost 80% + of its value    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Rinse and repeat    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*You’ll only be able to sell calls in this scenario, of 335c or higher, therefore if a spy's value drops where the 335c becomes worthless to sell, in this case if its value is less than a 100. Then exit your long dated call, and buy another one at spy’s current level"

Now the usual way to find the best long dated option to buy, is to find one that is very close to being OTM or even a dollar or two ITM. The best date is 4 months plus, because you'll have around two months of negligible theta.      \r\n\r\n\\>An important point here, the further out the better as the less theta, the more money this will generate long term. In addition, the more ITM the call is the better because it gives you more leeway, I’ll explain how to use this to your advantage later.    \r\n\r\n\\>So in our case, the best call to buy, is the 333c Jan 15 2021 for 1943$. Now you buy this, and you’re a proud owner of this call, now it’s time to start selling a call against it. The closest next expiry date is sep 14. Now the 336c call is looking pretty spicey with it’s 123$ premium, so we sell it.    \r\n\r\n\\>Now a very simple plug in of the call you sold into a \\[profit calculator\\]([https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/)) we see that for this call to remain over the 123$ worth spy will have to open at 337.50 or higher which is more then 4$ increase, which isn’t always likely. Now let’s go over the few scenarios that might occur:    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\* spy opens below 337.50, in which case the call will lose its value. As long as spy doesn’t close above 336, then you get to keep the premium, and if spy hovers around the current price and up to 334, the call becomes worth less then 20$, which means you can buy it back and get to keep the 100$ + difference    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Spy moons 9 points to 342 in one day. To close the call it would cost you 553$ as it would be worth 675. However, keep in mind that our long dated call is now worth 2397. Therefore, if we closed both options we will be at a total loss of 50$. This happens due to gamma of the short call being higher, due to it's shorter expiry date. If you had cash, you can buy back that call you sold, and lose 553 cash on hand, and be 50$ negative on your entire portfolio. Then you can turn around and sell more calls    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Spy has a retarded correction, or even god forbid a crash. In which case your long dated call will rapidly lose value and if spy loses more then 15% of its value, such as below 280$ then you lose 85% of the value of the spread. On the other a correction of 10%, would make the spread lose 65% of its value    \r\n\r\n\\>>It’s very important to remember, the type of equity that spy represents, which is the entire US market. For context, in the last 5 years, spy has only had 7 instances of a correction over 10% which can result in a heavy loss with this strategy. Now let’s look at the possible actions to take in every scenario.    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If the call has lost more then 80% of its value, or really any amount where your profits are over 120, them buy it back and close it.    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If the call becomes ITM and you’re forced to close it, then look at your options(no pun intended)    \r\n\r\n\\>>>\\*If you have enough cash to close it, and you don’t have any possible use for that available cash within the next two weeks then close it.     \r\n\r\n\\>>>\\*If you don’t have enough money to close the call or you’re not willing to lose that available cash, then simply close both options with either a profit or a loss depending on how had spy mooned that day.        \r\n\r\n\\>Now after you’ve done this once, let’s say you were successful and the call you sold was worth less and you made premium back. Now you have more cash on hand, and you’ve made money. Keep in mind, this also means more leeway, in case the next trade you might have to close the short call at a loss, either available cash loss, or net loss.     \r\n\r\n\\>Doing the math on possible profits. In a single month, you are able to sell 12 spy calls. If a spy remains flat, or has a slow upwards trend, and says on average you sell your calls at a profit of 100$, then you can make 1200$ from the spy, on a 2000$ investment. Every month, until expiry on the long call. If spy rises, then your initial call would also increase in value, resulting in extra profits when you eventually close it.     \r\n\r\n\\>\\_\\_NOW COMPARE THIS TO THE WHEEL STRATEGY\\_\\_ you would need a minimum of 33,000$ in order to buy a 100 shares of spy. Now first of all, the upfront collateral is ridiculous, and not many can afford it. If you’re asking yourself, well why can’t I use a cheaper stock, remember that only a spy has 12 contracts per month, every other etf and stock only has 4 per month. Furthermore, due to the sheer volume of spy, it's more reliable in terms of premiums.    \r\n\r\n\\>Here’s the best part too, spy increasing in value won’t benefit you with the wheel strategy, as you’re forced to sell your shares at the strike price of the short call. On the other hand, let’s compare the potential losses with this strategy, If spy were to lose 10% of value down to 300, then you’ll lose 3000$ vs only 1600$ with our long call. In addition, if spy keeps losing value you’ll keep losing money, while your gains are capped with the long call.     \r\n\r\n\\>Thereby the obvious advantages of this strategy:    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*We profit from spy’s increase of value and its flatness        \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Our maximum losses are capped, and the more successful calls we sell the less our risk becomes.        \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Our total needed collateral is a fraction of spy, at usually around 6%. Keep in mind that the same call, 333c at an expiration of sep 17 2021, a leap year call, is only 3000$, which is still only 9% of the value we’d usually need.     \r\n\r\n\\>And the best part, is how scalable this is, at an average of 100$ per contract sold profits, we can make back out entire about a month and a half, and we can buy another long contract. This way, spending 4000$, for an average return of 200$ per contract. This is ofcourse not counting our long dated calls increasing value with spy.     \r\n\r\n\\>This is to make your mouth water at the possible tendies. A 10,000$ investment, which is 5 contracts, can generate 6000$ per month on average, or even higher depending on market conditions. Keep in mind, the same amount of money, the 33,000 needed to use the wheel strategy, can generate 20,000 a month, vs the regular 1200 it can generate.    \r\n\r\n\\>Keep in mind, this only works if spy is in an flat and positive trend. To put things into perspective, it takes 1.5 months to generate enough money to buy a second contract.  Now that you’d be making double the money, that means you’ll need half the time, to get the second contract, and because we’re buying the contract at a higher strike price for the same price of around 2000, we keep covering higher and higher values of spy. So the second contract takes 1.5 months, the second would take three weeks, the third would take a week and half, the fourth would take 2 option dates, and them you’ll be making enough money to buy another call, every weekly option.    \r\n\r\n\\>I’ll make a part 2 about how to take this strategy further if you are successful to layer calls upon calls, virtually building a tranche that becomes very profitable.     \r\n\r\n\\>So I hope you employ this strategy to start making real money, and generating actual returns that are consistent, while still basking in the glory of theta gang, without needing the ridiculous amount of collateral\r\n\r\n\\>TLDR : For the absolute retards who don't want to read but instead want to know positions: you’ll need around 2000 - 2500 $ to employ this strategy correctly        \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Buy long dated spy call, 4+ months out such as 335c Spy Jan 15 2021     \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Then sell calls on weekly spy, 3-5$ OTM     \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If the call you sold becomes ITM, buy it back with the cash on hand, if you can't, close both positions, and re-enter your long position at a higher strike price\r\n\r\n\\>>\\*If not, buy the call back on the expiration day when it's lost 80% + of its value    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*Rinse and repeat    \r\n\r\n\\>>\\*You’ll only be able to sell calls in this scenario, of 335c or higher, therefore if a spy's value drops where the 335c becomes worthless to sell, in this case if its value is less than a 100. Then exit your long dated call, and buy another one at spy’s current level"

The good news is that the company that provides essential semiconductor capabilities to these companies is TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.) TSM contractually manufactures chipsets for 499 clients. By focusing solely on contracted production, TSM has the smallest (5nm) chip on the market and a 3nm chip on the horizon, creating an infrastructural economic moat insurmountable even for the aforementioned veteran firms, who struggle to produce 7nm chips by comparison.

              "Hey I know that some people talk about dix and gex etc but I have a pretty solid view on how MM activity with derivatives has an impact on the trading ranges (mainly arrived at this  with extensive backtesting). \r\n\r\nBased on the options activity from today’s close (I dont have the data for tomorrow open), we’re looking at an implied range of 336.5-343.3, with a current flush point of 334.0. So 334 will be the key level to watch as that is the current gamma flip (we’re currently positive gamma). I usually scalp puts if we go below gamma flip (from positive to negative if the trend is negative for price action), which is 334. 335 is also a key level as it contains a lot of written puts, so it may be a magnet point (a point where you will be kinda stuck at when you’re going lower). \r\n\r\nOn the bullish side, spy 342.0 is the key point that you want to break. Today, we had a lot of wednesday spx call sellers who had to cover hence the big rally, but in the end, profit takers came in and we saw a lower finish to the EOD. We’re still in positive gamma territory so you wanna buy the dips and sell the rips on SPY. Once that gamma flip point changes (we have to see tmrw at 9:35 am), we can see how far away we are from it and whether we can still employ the BTFD strategy. \r\n\r\nQQQ key level is 277, with amazing support at 270 and current resistance at 282. 277 is the flush point that you wanna look for. If we’re approaching 277, you may wanna puts as that 277 flushes fast. On the other hand, you want a clean break above 282 for a bullish upside. \r\n\r\nSPX september target currently for me is at 3500 based on the options activity, with a huge support at 3200. If 3200 breaks, we’ll go much lower. Hope that helps."

It is up 180% since its IPO on 8/20 and has consistently had 5% days even with the tech selloff. This brings me to 2) I think NNOX isn't a great buy now but definitely keep an eye on this. \r\n\r\n**Overview**\r\n\r\nX-ray technology is used for CT, mammography, fluoroscopy, angiogram, and dental purposes. While they are able to produce images, there are some pitfalls. First, the technology is energy-heavy and requires large machinery to operate. This reduces the global availability of X-ray scans and increases wait times to those that have access to the technology. The WHO reported in 2012 that 2/3 of the world’s population did not have access to medical imaging technology. Second, there is no uniform end-to-end process from scanning an image to billing the customer. Each step involves a different party, creating friction and extending the diagnostic times. \r\n\r\nNNOX is an Israel-based medical imaging company that uses microelectromechanical systems (MEMs) to produce results like that of an X-ray but at a cheaper cost from both a manufacturing and scanning perspective. The TAM for the medical imaging industry was around $20.1B in 2017 and projected to reach $30B by 2027. Strategic investors include SK Telecom, Foxconn, Yozma Korea, and Industrial Alliance.  \r\n\r\n**Product**\r\n\r\nNNOX offers both hardware and software components named Nanox.ARC and Nanox.Cloud, respectively. Nanox.ARC is a prototype that develops 3D, full-body scans with nanotechnology. The scans will be processed through chip technology compared to the X-ray’s hot cathode method which was developed 125 years ago. A typical X-ray scan costs $3,000 in the US and $300 globally, but NNOX is planning on charging $30 per scan. \r\nNanox.Cloud is a cloud-based software that will provide services and analysis of Nanox.ARC scans including image development, diagnostic annotation, AI assistance, billing, and much more. Having a streamlined software to supplement the hardware will assist doctors with their analysis and decrease diagnostic times for clients. \r\nWhile the product is revolutionary, it is still under development and is subject to FDA approval. If the FDA approves of the technology, the first Nanox.ARC will be deployed in the first half of 2021. \r\n\r\n**Business Model**\r\n\r\nNot only does NNOX offer disruptive technology at scale, but they also have a very different business model than the norm. Typically, hospitals and healthcare providers purchase medical imaging hardware up front which is only once source of static revenue. NNOX plans to drive their revenue in 3 different ways: \r\n1)\t**Sales.** NNOX has been selling the Nanox.ARC at a substantially lower cost than traditional machines and have also mentioned that they will give machines to hospitals for free. This provides a great incentive to have hospitals try the technology and can increase chance of future adoption. \r\n2)\t**Subscription.** If NNOX isn’t making money from selling hardware, how do they make money? Well, NNOX is using a pay-per-scan model, generating ARR rather than a one-time purchase. NNOX has also began negotiating contracts across Asia which require hospitals to run a certain amount of scans each month, creating guaranteed revenue once the product is deployed. \r\n3)\t**Licensing.** NNOX can also license the technology to other manufacturers if they see fit. \r\n\r\n**Conclusion** \r\n\r\nNNOX is a very speculative company with high upside potential and no financials or approved technology to back it up. I currently own shares and will plan to buy more if they receive FDA approval."

              "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\r\n\r\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\r\n\r\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\r\n*****\r\n> Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\r\n*****\r\n> The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\r\n*****\r\n> But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\r\n*****\r\n> “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.\r\n*****\r\n> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.\r\n*****\r\n> Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\r\n*****\r\n> Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\r\n*****\r\n> “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\r\n*****\r\n> Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.\r\n*****\r\n> BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\r\n*****\r\n> Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\r\n*****\r\n> “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\r\n*****\r\n> “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\r\n*****\r\n> The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\r\n*****\r\n> “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.\r\n*****\r\n> Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\r\n*****\r\n> Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\r\n*****\r\n> “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.\r\n*****\r\n> Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff. The dollar could decline, if the Fed sounds dovish, and that is a positive for stocks.\r\n*****\r\n> “I don’t think a 10% pullback [in Nasdaq] has caused enough pain to have people capitulate. This is just an ordinary correction, and we’re going to make new highs,” he said.\r\n*****\r\n\r\n# **This past week saw the following moves in the S&P:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL S&P TREE MAP FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/N5HwCxp.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Major Indices for this past week:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR INDICES FOR THE PAST WEEK!](https://i.imgur.com/jr7e4gT.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Major Futures Markets as of Friday's close:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE MAJOR FUTURES INDICES AS OF FRIDAY!](https://i.imgur.com/z7gtiCt.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Economic Calendar for the Week Ahead:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE FULL ECONOMIC CALENDAR FOR THE WEEK AHEAD!](https://i.postimg.cc/5tgPKm6Y/econcal1.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Percentage Changes for the Major Indices, WTD, MTD, QTD, YTD as of Friday's close:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/LUUHMDE.png))**\r\n\r\n# **S&P Sectors for the Past Week:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/CWgjO92.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Major Indices Pullback/Correction Levels as of Friday's close:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/c37y9mp.png)**\r\n\r\n# **Major Indices Rally Levels as of Friday's close:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/Eau1B5A.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Most Anticipated Earnings Releases for this week:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Here are the upcoming IPO's for this week:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i.imgur.com/SHieVRq.png))**\r\n\r\n# **Friday's Stock Analyst Upgrades & Downgrades:**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #1!](https://i.postimg.cc/fTBYdV6v/upgradesdowngrades1.png))**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #2!](https://i.postimg.cc/05GY8WnF/upgradesdowngrades2.png))**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART LINK #3!](https://i.postimg.cc/qMk8gsZR/upgradesdowngrades3.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # Election Charts You Need To See: Part 1\r\n\r\n> First off, our thoughts go out to everyone who was impacted by the tragic events of September 11, 2001—19 years ago today. It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\r\n\r\n> One of the top requests we’ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\r\n\r\n> Here’s how the S&P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven’t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> Here’s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn’t a lame duck president.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # Active Managers Do an About Face\r\n\r\n> The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\r\n\r\n> This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\r\n\r\n> Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\r\n\r\n> At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\r\n\r\n> With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\r\n\r\n> There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\r\n\r\n> One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\r\n\r\n> These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\r\n\r\n> Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\r\n\r\n> Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\r\n\r\n> Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\r\n\r\n> While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\r\n\r\n> While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\r\n\r\n> “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\r\n\r\n> * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\r\n> * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\r\n> * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\r\n> * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\r\n> * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\r\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\r\n\r\n> With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\r\n\r\n> Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\r\n\r\n> Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\r\n\r\n> What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\r\n\r\n> While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\r\n\r\n> As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JGV5KjX/ervol1.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\r\n\r\n> # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\r\n\r\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\r\n\r\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # FedEx Corp. $232.79\r\n**FedEx Corp.

              "Good Saturday morning to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.\r\n\r\nHere is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning September 14th, 2020.\r\n\r\n# **Investors will look to the Fed to soothe the market next week, but that may be a tall order  - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/11/investors-will-look-to-the-fed-to-soothe-the-market-next-week-but-that-may-be-a-tall-order.html)**\r\n*****\r\n> Markets are looking to the Federal Reserve to be a soothing force when it meets in the week ahead, but stocks could remain choppy if the central bank disappoints and as investors focus on the election and the economic recovery.\r\n*****\r\n> The Fed’s two-day meeting is expected to end Wednesday with minor tweaks to its statement and some clarity on how it plans to use forward guidance. The Fed also updates its economic and interest rate outlook, including forecasts for 2023 for the first time.\r\n*****\r\n> But Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at Prudential Financial, said the stock market could easily be disappointed because the Fed is unlikely to offer more clarity on monetary policy, such as plans for bond buying.\r\n*****\r\n> “The market is concerned the Fed is not going to give us explicit readings on their plans for monetary policy,″ she said. The Fed’s extraordinary policies have been an important factor behind the stock market’s 50% surge from the March 23 low, and it’s also seen as a major factor limiting the depth of the market’s sell-off.\r\n*****\r\n> Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, said the Fed is not likely to tweak much and it continues to buy $80 billion a month in Treasurys. “I don’t think they’ll do anything to the markets either way,” he said.\r\n*****\r\n> Stocks were volatile in the past week, falling hard, rallying, falling and rallying again. That left the S&P 500 with a weekly decline of about 2.5%, its worst week since June. The harder hit Nasdaq was down about 4.1% for the week, its worst weekly decline since March. The quadruple expiration of options and futures at the end of the coming week could add to the volatility.\r\n*****\r\n> Bank of America strategists said the bond market is watching the Fed for any balance sheet adjustments and the changes to its forward guidance, which includes the Fed’s recent tweak in its inflation policy. The Fed changed its policy of focusing on a target inflation rate to an average rate, meaning it may not tighten policy if inflation overshoots its 2% target.\r\n*****\r\n> “We see risk the rates market is underwhelmed by the guidance provided by the Fed, which would support higher back-end rates and a steeper curve,” the Bank of America strategists noted. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield slid in the past week, touching 0.67% Friday, and it could move higher, meaning bonds may sell-off, if the Fed does not clarify policy around its bond buying program.\r\n*****\r\n> Krosby said the stock market is hoping for a dovish Fed. “The market needs that now because fiscal policy is going nowhere,” she said.\r\n*****\r\n> BTIG strategist Julian Emanuel said the market could focus on the fact that Congress failed to make headway on fiscal stimulus, if the economic data begins to disappoint.\r\n*****\r\n> Retail sales for August are expected Wednesday morning, as the Fed meets. They are expected to rise by 1%, and that should be an important look at whether the lack of enhanced unemployment benefits, which expired July 31, impacted consumer spending. Among other things, Republicans and Democrats could not agree how to replace the $600 weekly payment to the unemployed.\r\n*****\r\n> “Depending on the polls and the economic data, the probability of stimulus rises and falls,” said Emanuel, head of equity and derivatives strategy.\r\n*****\r\n> “Our view is that next week is just going to be lots of back and forth with the potential for a further extension of the range for the downside, if the political narrative gets more inflamed,” said Emanuel. Emanuel expects the market to remain choppy and fall further into the month of October, as investors worry about the uncertainty around the presidential election.\r\n*****\r\n> The Fed’s meeting this week is its last before the election, and analysts expect Fed Chairman Jerome Powell to sound reassuring that the Fed will do whatever it takes to support the economy. Powell holds a briefing after the meeting Wednesday, and he is expected to also be asked about the potential for higher inflation. The Fed has said it is more concerned about disinflation, but recent inflation data has been hotter than expected, though still well below 2%.\r\n*****\r\n> “There is a tug of war between those who say buy chips now because inflation is moving higher, versus those why are saying deflationary forces are still weaving their way into the economy,” said Krosby.\r\n*****\r\n> Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global Forex, said he expects the Fed to sound reassuring but it’s not likely to discuss a target for bond purchases or the yield curve controls some investors were hoping for. Yield curve control would mean the Fed would try to manage interest rates by targeting its purchases of specific Treasurys. For instance, it may focus on trying to keep longer duration yields lower, and buy the 10-year.\r\n*****\r\n> Chandler also noted the Fed’s $7 trillion balance sheet has recently declined by about $100 billion from its peak, and its bond purchases are falling behind the European Central Bank.\r\n*****\r\n> “My sense is the Fed is going to keep saying it’s not worried about inflation. Its bigger worry is downside risks. They’ll repeat their call for fiscal stimulus which after this week seems less likely,” he said.\r\n*****\r\n> Chandler said the stock market could remain choppy in the coming week, but he does not expect a sharp selloff.

It is a day to reflect and remember those who were lost.\r\n\r\n> One of the top requests we’ve had here at LPL Research is for more charts on the election. Over the next week, we will share some of our favorite charts on this very important subject.\r\n\r\n> Here’s how the S&P 500 Index performs under various presidents and congressional makeups. The best scenario has historically been a Democratic president and Republican Congress, while a Republican president and Democratic Congress has been the weakest.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> Building on this, a split Congress historically has been one of the best scenarios for investors.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-2.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> The best scenario under a Republican president is a split Congress, a potential positive for 2020 that has played out after the massive reversal in the stock market since March.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i1.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-3.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> Looking at the four-year presidential cycle shows that stocks haven’t been down during a year the president was up for a re-election since FDR in the 1940s, another bullish tailwind for 2020.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-4.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> Here’s another look at this, as stocks historically have done much better when there isn’t a lame duck president.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.11.20-Blog-Chart-5.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # Active Managers Do an About Face\r\n\r\n> The National Association of Active Investment Managers (NAAIM) has an index which tracks the exposure of its members to US equity markets. Each week, members are asked to provide a number that represents their exposure to markets. A reading of -200 means they are leveraged short, -100 indicates fully short, 0 is neutral, 100% is fully invested, and 200% indicates leveraged long. Two weeks ago, in our Bespoke Report, we highlighted the fact that the exposure index had moved to one of the highest levels in its 15-year history. Now, just two weeks later, these same active managers have reigned in their exposure considerably as this week's reading dropped from just under 100 to 53.1.\r\n\r\n> This week's drop was the second-largest one week decline in the index's history and just the 10th time that the index lost more than a third (33 points) in a single week. The most recent occurrence was back in early March in the middle of the Covid crash, and every other prior period where the index saw a similar drop, the S&P 500 was also down every time by an average of 2.3%. Therefore, it's not much of a surprise to see the big drop this week given the big declines in the market. But what about going forward? Do big drops in the NAAIM Index mean a bounce back for markets or further declines?\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/091120-NAAIM.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # The Most and Least Heavily Shorted Stocks in the Russell 1,000\r\n\r\n> Below is an updated look at the most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000. Each of these 30 stocks has at least 15% of its equity float sold short.\r\n\r\n> At the top of the list is Nordstrom (JWN) with 38.66% of its float sold short. With a YTD decline of 61.86%, the shorts have crushed it with JWN this year.\r\n\r\n> With its huge portfolio of office and retail real estate, Brookfield Property REIT(BPYU) has the second highest short interest in the Russell 1,000 at 33.7%. BPYU is down 35.7% YTD.\r\n\r\n> There are plenty of other well-known companies on the list of the most heavily shorted stocks. Examples include American Airlines (AAL), Virgin Galactic (SPCE), LendingTree (TREE), Wayfair (W), Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS), ADT, TripAdvisor (TRIP), Beyond Meat (BYND), and Kohl's (KSS).\r\n\r\n> One name that is no longer on the list of most shorted stocks is Tesla (TSLA). When we provided an update on short interest back in February (a pre-COVID world), Tesla (TSLA) had more than 17% of its float sold short, but that number is all the way down to 8.3% as of the most recent filing.\r\n\r\n> These 30 stocks with the highest short interest are down an average of 3.01% since last Wednesday (9/2) when the S&P 500 made its last closing high. That's actually a little bit better than the 3.55% average decline for the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000. And year-to-date, these 30 stocks are up an average of 0.60% versus an average gain of 0.81% for the rest of the index. That's not much of a difference!\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/most-heavily-shorted.png))**\r\n\r\n> Below is a list of the 30 least shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 as a percentage of equity float. None of these stocks have more than 0.71% of their float sold short, and they're mostly made up of more conservative names in the Health Care and Consumer Staples sectors.\r\n\r\n> Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) has the lowest short interest as a percentage of float in the Russell 1,000 at just 0.36%. Microsoft (MSFT) -- one of the key mega-cap Tech names -- has the second lowest short interest, followed by Merck (MRK), Eli Lilly (LLY), and Medtronic (MDT).\r\n\r\n> Somewhat surprisingly, Amazon (AMZN) is the sixth least shorted stock in the entire Russell 1,000. While AMZN is still thought of as a high-flying momentum name by many investors, its short interest levels tell a much different story, painting it as more of a non-cyclical stock like Pepsi (PEP), Procter & Gamble (PG), or Coca- Cola (KO).\r\n\r\n> While the 30 most heavily shorted stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up 0.60% YTD, the 30 least shorted stocks in the index are up much more at +8%. This group has MSFT, AMZN, HD, and AAPL to thank for that strong performance!\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/leastshorted.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # 5 Lessons Learned About Rising Rates\r\n\r\n> While the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield over the last cycle was decidedly lower, as shown in LPL’s Chart of the Day, there were still six extended periods where it rose at least 0.75%, and in two of those it rose almost 2%. Looking ahead, economic growth below potential, slack in the labor market, and an extremely supportive Federal Reserve (Fed) may limit rate pressure in the near term, but with interest rates already low and massive stimulus in place, we believe the overall direction is likely to be higher.\r\n\r\n> “Even in a falling rate period there are lessons from the last cycle about rising rates,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Officer Burt White. “Among them: Careful when the Fed stops buying and sometimes the best defense is a good offense.”\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i2.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/9.9.20-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1))**\r\n\r\n> While every economic cycle is unique, the last cycle highlighted these key takeaways about periods of rising rates:\r\n\r\n> * **Careful when the Fed stops buying.**  The two drivers of rising rates last cycle were economic growth and Fed bond purchases, also known as quantitative easing (QE). The Fed buys bonds to keep rates down, but the start of Fed buying has actually been the time when rates rise—likely on expectations that the purchases would help strengthen the economy. These periods also often followed large rate declines either because markets anticipated the start of Fed buying or the economy was faltering. The takeaway: unless the economy is really taking off, any rising-rate period may pause for an extended period, or even reverse, when the Fed backs off bond purchases.\r\n> * **Sometime the best defense is a good offense.** Lower-quality, more economically sensitive bond sectors actually performed well during periods of rising rates during the last cycle. Rate gains were largely driven by economic improvement rather than a large pick-up in inflation, and that’s typically a good environment for sectors like high-yield bonds and bank loans. The downside is that these are much riskier bond sectors and don’t provide the potential diversification benefits of higher-quality bonds during periods of stock declines.\r\n> * **Don’t expect TIPS to provide much resilience because of their inflation adjustment.** Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are high-quality bonds that have provided a little extra insulation against rising rates compared to similarly dated Treasuries when inflation expectations increased. TIPS prices are adjusted for inflation, but even with the adjustment, they are still very sensitive to rates.\r\n> * **Investment-grade corporates can both hurt and help.** If credit spreads narrow when rates are rising, investment-grade corporates can post some solid gains in a rising-rate environment, but if spreads are holding steady or even widening, they can be very sensitive to changes in Treasury yields, potentially (although not often) even more sensitive than Treasuries.\r\n> * **Mortgage-backed securities (MBS)** have not provided as much insulation as corporates, but they also have had less downside. While MBS have certainly outperformed Treasuries during periods of rising rates, they have not performed as well as investment-grade corporates. But they also have come with less downside, losing only 1.4% in their worst performing period compared to a 4% loss during the worst period for corporates.\r\nWith the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher. We are playing some offense with our equity exposure, which allows us to emphasize a focus on higher-quality bonds. Among bond sectors, we are emphasizing MBS and still prefer investment-grade corporates over Treasuries. History may not repeat, but if it rhymes, this positioning may help add resilience to a fixed income portfolio if rates extend their move off recent lows.\r\n\r\n> With the Fed still providing strong stimulus and economic growth potentially poised to accelerate, we currently see an increased risk of rates moving higher.

Below we take a look at the best and worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 since the 9/2 high for the S&P. For each stock, we also include its YTD total return and its percentage change from the 3/23 COVID Crash low through 9/2.\r\n\r\n> Capri Holdings (CPRI) is up more than any other stock in the Russell 1,000 since 9/2 with a gain of 17.43%. Even after the recent gains, however, Capri -- the holding company for brands like Michael Kors, Jimmy Choo, and Versace -- is still down 52.9% year-to-date.\r\n\r\n> Only four other stocks are up more than 10% since 9/2 -- Beyond Meat (BYND), PVH, Virtu Financial (VIRT), and Reinsurance Group (RGA). Interestingly, BYND and VIRT are also up big (~80%) year-to-date, while PVH and RGA are both down more than 35% year-to-date.\r\n\r\n> What stands out the most about the list of winners is that only one Technology stock made the cut -- Sabre (SABR). Most names come from the two consumer sectors including cruise-liners like Carnival (CCL), Royal Caribbean (RCL) and Norwegian Cruise (NCLH), Kohl's (KSS), Williams-Sonoma (WSM), Six Flags (SIX), Foot Locker (FL), and Ralph Lauren (RL). Both UBER and LYFT also made the cut with gains of 6% since 9/2. The 30 biggest winners since 9/2 are still down an average of 20% year-to-date, while the rest of the stocks in the Russell 1,000 are up an average of 1.46% YTD.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/bestsince92.png))**\r\n\r\n> While only one Technology stock made the list of biggest winners since 9/2, the sector accounts for two-thirds of the 30 biggest losers over the same time frame. As shown below, since 9/2, the six worst performing stocks in the Russell 1,000 and ten of the worst twelve all come from Tech. Notably, though, these 30 stocks that have all fallen more than 12% since 9/2 are still up an average of 5.6% YTD. Were it not for the horrid YTD performance of the Energy stocks that made the list, the average YTD gain would be even higher.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2020/09/worstsince92.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # Typical Early September Weakness Recovers Mid-Month Sells Off Month-End\r\n\r\n> As of yesterday’s close the market was down more than the historical average performance in September. DJIA was down nearly -3.3%, S&P 500 was down -4.8%, NASDAQ was off 7.9%, Russell 1000 was down -5.2% and Russell 2000 lost 3.7%. Today’s rally looks like the beginning of a textbook mid-month recovery rally However, the second half of September has historically been weaker than the first half. The week after options expiration week can be treacherous with S&P 500 logging 23 weekly losses in 30 years since 1990. End-of-quarter portfolio restructuring, and window dressing can amplify the impacts of any negative headlines.\r\n\r\n> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/75a927aee973e2c31a0d76ff0be15d59/fa78a7e1d90fbdef-fe/s500x750/8f217c04559740d2db6c24b7ea855ecd579ec195.jpg))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S MOST NOTABLE EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/Mp84zhth/er1.png))**\r\n###### **([CLICK HERE FOR NEXT WEEK'S HIGHEST VOLATILITY EARNINGS RELEASES!](https://i.postimg.cc/3JGV5KjX/ervol1.png))**\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nBelow are some of the notable companies coming out with earnings releases this upcoming trading week ahead which includes the date/time of release & consensus estimates courtesy of Earnings Whispers:\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 Before Market Open:***\r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n> # ***Monday 9.14.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR MONDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/1LCuH7Z.png))\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Tuesday  9.15.20 Before Market Open:***\r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/IU3xGVJ.png))\r\n\r\n> # ***Tuesday 9.15.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR TUESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/EOC9Qwy.png))\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 Before Market Open:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/faX2lNR.png))\r\n\r\n> # ***Wednesday 9.16.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR WEDNESDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 Before Market Open:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!](https://i.imgur.com/CdwssKa.png))\r\n\r\n> # ***Thursday 9.17.20 After Market Close:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR THURSDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 Before Market Open:*** \r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S PRE-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # ***Friday 9.18.20 After Market Close:***\r\n> ###### ([CLICK HERE FOR FRIDAY'S AFTER-MARKET EARNINGS TIME & ESTIMATES!]())\r\n(NONE.)\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n> # FedEx Corp. $232.79\r\n**FedEx Corp.

I’m looking at short-term weekly or potentially even daily calls that could be entered at market open as an earnings continuation play if the overall market is trending upwards.\r\n\r\n- PTON: “Peloton crushes estimates as sales surge 172%, expects strong demand to continue into 2021. With such strong demand for its bike and treadmill, it said it doesn’t expect to return to “normalized order-to-delivery windows” in the U.S. before the end of the fiscal second quarter” [CNBC]. I suggested this as an earnings run-up play and we could now potentially play this similar to ORCL as mentioned above. Slightly OTM weekly calls at market open if the overall market sentiment is positive might be a viable option. These could be sold as early as end of day tomorrow.\r\n\r\n- AAPL: Apple continued to sell-off today after yesterday bounce-back and has established itself as the QQQ momentum leader over the last days. Short-term calls or puts depending on market sentiment at open might be a viable trade.\r\n\r\n- NKLA: Nikola might be the most overvalued company with a market cap > $10B in the US market. I am expecting yesterday’s sell-off to continue and I am looking at short-term OTM puts >$30 that could be flipped before market close.

              "So after the amazing responses I got on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ir8lcs/why_the_poor_mans_covered_call_is_the_most/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I decided to re write this entire strategy but with everyone’s advice and my own ideas in order to protect against possible retarded market movements.\r\n\r\nFor people who didn’t see my previous post, this strategy is able to generate the premium’s of the theta gang while only needing 2000 - 5000$ depending on how you set it up, while simultaneously benefiting from the markets average positive trend, and can still average positive if a sudden correction or crash happens, or even spy mooning because of great market news.\r\n\r\nI’ll summarize the entire strategy again, however this time I am going to be bit more concise and to the point, however at the end I’ll have another **TLDR** for the autistic motherfuckers who don’t want to read this, but I recommend you do so you understand exactly what’s happening.\r\n\r\n***Option Basics:***\r\n\r\nA call option gives you the right to buy a stock at a given strike price by a certain date. Writing a call contract, otherwise known as a covered call, obligates you to own 100 shares of the underlying equity, in order to sell them at the strike price if the contract is exercised.\r\n\r\nA call debit spread is buying a call at a certain strike price while at the same time selling a call at a higher strike price at the same expiration. A hedged strategy that makes buying calls cheaper and protects you against IV crush, however it caps your gains\r\n\r\nA diagonal spread is buying a call at a certain strike price at a certain date, and then selling a call at a shorter expiration, thereby benefiting from theta decay.\r\n\r\nTheta wheel strategy is having enough collateral to buy 100 shares of the equity then selling puts and collecting premiums. When exercised, you use the 100 shares you own to sell calls against them thereby collecting more premium. When eventually exercised you sell the 100 shares, get your collateral back and begin selling puts again.\r\n\r\n**Facts you need to know about the Greeks:**\r\n\r\nThe four greeks that are most important us in this strategy are Delta, Theta, Gamma, and Vega\r\n\r\n*Delta* determines how much your option gains or loses value based on a 1 dollar change in the underlying equities price\r\n\r\n*Theta* determines how much value the option loses everyday as it gets closer to expiration\r\n\r\n*Gamma* determines how much delta increases (for a call contract) or decreases (for a put contract) with every 1$ move of the underlying equities price\r\n\r\n*Vega* determines the options values worth based on the current IV.\r\n\r\n***What the Strategy aims to do:***\r\n\r\nThis strategy aims to replicate what Theta gang is able to do, without needing the ridiculous collateral. At spy’s current price at the time of writing (338), you’d need 33,800$ to be able to sell contracts which most people don’t have. This strategy aims to change that. Furthermore, after much deliberation, this updated strategy can actually benefit heavily from sudden corrections or even spy mooning a ridiculous amount, while still being able to generate income from the premiums you’ll be selling.\r\n\r\n***How does it work:***\r\n\r\nSo the idea is to do this. Buying a slightly ITM far dated (4 months to a year) spy call. Such as the 333 Sep 17 2021 for 3250$. Then buying an OTM spy put that is a month away, such as the Spy 325p Oct 14 2020 for 459$.\r\n\r\nAfter establishing these two positions, you would start selling a spy call that is a few points OTM, and has the closest expiration date, such as the Spy 341c Sep 16 for 134$, and at the same time, buying a Spy 346c Sep 16 for 20$.\r\n\r\nNow what have these four positions established. Our long call now acts as collateral to sell weekly calls against. Thereby, doing this would allow us to consistently sell these calls for profits. The call that we bought that was super OTM was our insurance in case the spy decides to moon, I’ll explain why that's bad in the next section. Our put also acts as insurance in case we get a correction or even a crash.\r\n\r\n**Now let’s look at the multiple scenarios of what spy can do, and how to respond to each:**\r\n\r\n* If on the 16th, spy is between 337 and 343. Both of our Sep 16 calls are almost worthless so we close both on a net profit and then sell a call with a sep 18 strike and buy another one at a higher strike with the same date, and begin this entire operation.\r\n* If on the 16th, Spy decides to be annoying and is over 343, between 344 and 348. Then you’ll close both contracts at a net loss, however your maximum loss in this scenario is 41$. Remember you still own the long dated call and our protection put. So we simply can go around and sell more calls again at a higher strike and rinse and repeat.\r\n* If on the 16th, Spy decides to fucking moon more then 3%. Anything over 349, is net positive for you, as while the call you sold and the put you bought are both losing value, the two calls you bought Delta’s are faster, thereby you’ll net positive. In this scenario, close the entire spread and establish another spread when you’ve found a good entry point.\r\n* If on the 16th, spy drops between 316 and 336. Sorry sir, you’ve been shafted. While you got to keep premium from the call you sold. The OTM call you bought is worthless, and the long call is rapidly losing value, and the delta of your put isn’t high enough to out pace your long call yet, so you average negative. However, are you ready for this, your maximum loss is only 110$, at specifically 325.5, anything below that and your loss is lower, and anything lower then 316, you actually net positive because your put is now worth more then the entire spread, thereby is spy decides to correct or even crash, you’re cashin out. Anyways, if the call you bought isn’t super ITM, such as at 300 as someone suggested last time, then close the entire spread for a minimal loss or even net gain depending on the price and establish it at the appropriate price.\r\n\r\nA quick note, the way I like to use the put, is that after 15 days have passed, close down the put and open a new one at the appropriate price and delta’s. That way you’ve only lost 200 - 300$ to theta which you’ve recovered from premiums and your long call appreciating in value as spy keeps climbing.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n[How the spread pans out](https://preview.redd.it/oj1mdq32m9n51.png?width=221&format=png&auto=webp&s=3413e17f96b90eb7030fbffe06bcaede07c8ee6e)\r\n\r\n***Why those options and how to make the Greeks your*** ***BITCH***\\*\\*\\*:\\*\\*\\*\r\n\r\nThe biggest problem we have is Spy moving upwards too quickly. You see, while our long dated call has a Delta of 0.5752 and a Gamma of 0.0083, our short dated call has a Delta of 0.3397 but a gamma of 0.0612. You see if spy starts increasing quickly, the delta of the call we sold will surpass our long call’s delta, and result in a loss for us. Hence we have the OTM call as protection against gamma.\r\n\r\nOur put position is there to protect us against a possible correction or crash of a spy. Its ATM which means gamma is at it’s highest, while also not being super long dated, only a month out, which means the Delta will be high enough, that spy moving down, we will still average out positive.\r\n\r\nWhat we are taking advantage of is theta decay. Our short dated call will rapidly lose value as the days roll on. The theta on the call is -0.5489 which is super useful to use if the spy is flat or moves relatively slowly.\r\n\r\n*Important point here to establish about set up:*\r\n\r\nYou see, how the different Delta’s and Gamma’s interact here is crucial for this strategy. For example buying a put that is ATM, means that the delta would be high, which is great for us if spy goes down because we average positive. However, when spy rises, the two calls we bought, the long dated and the super OTM, have to both fight an ITM short dated call, and a semi dated put. Which means, in that range where you are negative at the top, the loss is much greater.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, buying a deep OTM put on spy, means the delta is much lower, which may help the top side of your spread but will make your loss if spy goes down greater.\r\n\r\nRemember, spy has only moved 10%, 8 times in history, 4 of which were in 1932. So the odds of a huge movement are relatively low. It’s more important to be protected of a spy 5.5% move instead of a 10%+ move. Thereby, finding a put, at a sufficient delta that helps both your top and lower legs of the strat to minimize your losses is crucial. I found that for this entry, the 325 put is the best.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the call that you buy that is OTM, can’t be too far OTM otherwise it doesn’t protect us from a slight increase of Spy so we lose more money, and it also can’t be too close otherwise it cuts into our premiums. My personal goal is to average out a 100$ per contract, thereby the 346 call was the best option.\r\n\r\n***Why this strategy is so*** ***FUCKING*** ***powerful, and how it’s better then the wheel:***\r\n\r\nYou see, you are sufficiently protected from all sides. If spy decides to correct in any way. The calls premium that we sold will become ours and give our Put time to ramp up its Delta, that way, it starts to gain value faster then our call, thereby protecting us from a downward movement. The beautiful thing is that it will consistently outpace our long call, therefore we will always net positive.\r\n\r\nNow remember, this strategy generates money in three ways, either a big upswing or correction on spy, or if spy simply remains flat. However, even if it does none of that, you’re still sufficiently protected to limit your losses. Remember the goal is to consistently sell calls and benefit. Furthermore, the put we have also allows us to sell weekly puts, however I do not recommend this. The put’s job is to protect us from a big downward movement of spy, adding a sold put means that if spy suddenly lost 15%, that put we sold will fuck us over, and we will net a 30% + loss.\r\n\r\nNow why is this so much more powerful then theta gang strategy. You benefit from every spy movement. Even if spy moves unfavorably, our calls and puts are all sufficiently placed to protect us while also generating us premiums. Remember, spy is always on a positive trend, so in the end, if your spy call is sufficiently far enough, those minutia movement won’t hurt as much, because you will average positive.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, this gives you a larger control on big market trends. If the market’s switch to being bearish, you can weather the initial down turn as your equities are protected, while at the same time can switch and adjust this strategy around a put position.\r\n\r\nWhy does theta gang pale in comparison? Our maximum losses on a single trade are no more than a 110, and we can always re adjust, we never need more equity to simply keep selling contracts, Furthermore, these huge movements won’t fuck us over, as we’re not holding the bag like owning a 100 shares of spy that have lost significant value if spy crashes or corrects. While at the same time we actually benefit from large market movements.\r\n\r\n***Implied Volatility and how to Lube up Vega:***\r\n\r\nIV can be your worst and best friend, so its important to understand how it works and how to hedge against it. IV increases if there is expectations of more volatile movements of the underlying stock. Right now, spy is hovering around 23% volatility, while during the correction in the last two weeks, it spiked up to 31%.\r\n\r\nThe ticker VXX, actually tracks and represents the volatility of spy. Thereby, if you are in a low volatility environment, (right now its relatively low IV, but historically IV should hover around 19-20%) its best to hedge with VXX calls 2-4 months out that ate ATM, in order to benefit from a IV rise and to hedge against it, if it adversely affects your options due to Vega. Furthermore, if you are in a high IV environment, then its a good idea to buy ATM vxx puts in order to hedge against IV crush, thereby protecting your options.\r\n\r\n***Tips and some thoughts:***\r\n\r\nBuying a spy call that is deeper ITM, means we can keep selling calls even if spy corrects, however you’ll have to account for the higher delta which your put will need to account for.\r\n\r\nLearning some basic chart analysis and how to read broad market movements will tremendously help you in timing this right in order to average out positive\r\n\r\nThis is a very high maintenance strategy, but if done right can generate you consistent returns and is more profitable then Theta gang in the long run.\r\n\r\nSome ***smart tips*** to use, if you’re selling puts, try not to sell them on a friday so you don’t have to worry about some retarded weekend move.\r\n\r\nThis tip is useful both selling calls and puts, always put a stop order at a 20% loss or higher and establish a wide bid ask spread, especially if you’re holding something before the market opens and you’re expecting a big movement, as this protects you if something is moving against you, just remember not to go over your PDT limit if you have less then 25k.\r\n\r\n***Conclusion:***\r\n\r\nAfter doing all of these steps, this strategy will be fully hedged and prepared for any market movement, both in the short and long term. While this is a high maintenance strat with a lot of nuances, it can be done quite effectively, and you can scalp consistent profit if you do it right. It is far cheaper then the Theta Strategy, and can generate more profit. I hope this was clearer and covered all the things I missed in the last post. And yes there will be a part 2, on how to layer this strategy on top of itself as Spy keeps rising in value in order to establish a mouth watering tranche that can generate consistent income. I hope yall employ this and let me know how it goes, I wanna see them tendies baby.\r\n\r\n*TLDR: For the faggots who didn’t read*\r\n\r\n* Buy long dated(4 months to a year) spy calls that are ITM.\r\n* Buy a 8-10% OTM put that expires a month out\r\n* Sell a slightly OTM spy call at the nearest expiration\r\n* Buy a further OTM spy call at the nearest expiration (should cost less 25% of the call you sold)\r\n* Wait\r\n* If spy is flat or moves a lil down at the nearest expiration, then close both short term calls and rinse and repeat at current spy level.\r\n* If spy loses more then 8%, close all positions, and re establish the spread(your loss is capped at around 80-180)\r\n* If spy gains a few points and the call you sold becomes ITM, then close both short dated calls and re establish two more at the appropriate spy level (your maximum loss should be less then 50 if you did it right)\r\n* If spy moons a ridiculous amount, 8% plus, close the entire spread and re open at the appropriate price."

If the market’s switch to being bearish, you can weather the initial down turn as your equities are protected, while at the same time can switch and adjust this strategy around a put position.\r\n\r\nWhy does theta gang pale in comparison? Our maximum losses on a single trade are no more than a 110, and we can always re adjust, we never need more equity to simply keep selling contracts, Furthermore, these huge movements won’t fuck us over, as we’re not holding the bag like owning a 100 shares of spy that have lost significant value if spy crashes or corrects. While at the same time we actually benefit from large market movements.\r\n\r\n***Implied Volatility and how to Lube up Vega:***\r\n\r\nIV can be your worst and best friend, so its important to understand how it works and how to hedge against it. IV increases if there is expectations of more volatile movements of the underlying stock. Right now, spy is hovering around 23% volatility, while during the correction in the last two weeks, it spiked up to 31%.\r\n\r\nThe ticker VXX, actually tracks and represents the volatility of spy. Thereby, if you are in a low volatility environment, (right now its relatively low IV, but historically IV should hover around 19-20%) its best to hedge with VXX calls 2-4 months out that ate ATM, in order to benefit from a IV rise and to hedge against it, if it adversely affects your options due to Vega. Furthermore, if you are in a high IV environment, then its a good idea to buy ATM vxx puts in order to hedge against IV crush, thereby protecting your options.\r\n\r\n***Tips and some thoughts:***\r\n\r\nBuying a spy call that is deeper ITM, means we can keep selling calls even if spy corrects, however you’ll have to account for the higher delta which your put will need to account for.\r\n\r\nLearning some basic chart analysis and how to read broad market movements will tremendously help you in timing this right in order to average out positive\r\n\r\nThis is a very high maintenance strategy, but if done right can generate you consistent returns and is more profitable then Theta gang in the long run.\r\n\r\nSome ***smart tips*** to use, if you’re selling puts, try not to sell them on a friday so you don’t have to worry about some retarded weekend move.\r\n\r\nThis tip is useful both selling calls and puts, always put a stop order at a 20% loss or higher and establish a wide bid ask spread, especially if you’re holding something before the market opens and you’re expecting a big movement, as this protects you if something is moving against you, just remember not to go over your PDT limit if you have less then 25k.\r\n\r\n***Conclusion:***\r\n\r\nAfter doing all of these steps, this strategy will be fully hedged and prepared for any market movement, both in the short and long term. While this is a high maintenance strat with a lot of nuances, it can be done quite effectively, and you can scalp consistent profit if you do it right. It is far cheaper then the Theta Strategy, and can generate more profit. I hope this was clearer and covered all the things I missed in the last post. And yes there will be a part 2, on how to layer this strategy on top of itself as Spy keeps rising in value in order to establish a mouth watering tranche that can generate consistent income. I hope yall employ this and let me know how it goes, I wanna see them tendies baby.\r\n\r\n*TLDR: For the faggots who didn’t read*\r\n\r\n* Buy long dated(4 months to a year) spy calls that are ITM.\r\n* Buy a 8-10% OTM put that expires a month out\r\n* Sell a slightly OTM spy call at the nearest expiration\r\n* Buy a further OTM spy call at the nearest expiration (should cost less 25% of the call you sold)\r\n* Wait\r\n* If spy is flat or moves a lil down at the nearest expiration, then close both short term calls and rinse and repeat at current spy level.\r\n* If spy loses more then 8%, close all positions, and re establish the spread(your loss is capped at around 80-180)\r\n* If spy gains a few points and the call you sold becomes ITM, then close both short dated calls and re establish two more at the appropriate spy level (your maximum loss should be less then 50 if you did it right)\r\n* If spy moons a ridiculous amount, 8% plus, close the entire spread and re open at the appropriate price."

It definitely helps to be able to have a constant watch on what's happening, I pulled out of $NKLA when the first reports came in and I dumped $PTON right after the market opened to lock in that earnings pop.  Honestly, if I wasn't right on top of this shit all the time, I would have completely sucked eggs the last 2 days, instead i'm up 4% (caught the late $FDX bump)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm just curious how many people just YOLO completely or if you lord over your shit like a helicopter parent."

The event held every fall, almost always results in the addition of a new iPhone series and/or Apple product. This year’s event should be no different as analysts and tech journalists offer their speculation on what we should expect from the tech giant. Most expect to see the reveal of the new iPhone 12, which many believe will be Apple’s first 5G product. Others are hoping for Apple to reveal a new generation of AirPods, under the name AirPod studio offering studio quality sound. Fortunately for us the guessing game has come to an end. Tim Apple himself, Apple’s big boss man and playboy has come forward with some exciting news about tomorrow’s event. Tomorrow on 9/15/20 Apple will release its newest phone, the iPhone 12, but perhaps even more exciting, they will be releasing their newest accessory  “Apple Scuba”. Apple Scuba is a new function on the next generation iPhone series that allows users to breathe underwater via a breathing apparatus that can be plugged into the phone’s charging port. Users simply plug in the new accessory, open the Apple Scuba app, put their mouth on the mouth piece and click the lock button for fresh Apple oxygen. Tim Apple believes this will allow users to seamless travel underwater like never before possible and states “I wanted users to experience underwater travel like never before possible”. This is definitely going to set Apple apart from its competitors and help people that want to breathe underwater breathe underwater."

The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.9%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%. The Russell 2000 outperformed with a 2.7% gain.\r\n* The gains were broad and steady, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors finishing in positive territory, including seven that rose at least 1.0%. The information technology sector's 2.1% gain was the most influential, but the real estate sector (+2.2%) eked out the top spot. The communication services sector (+0.1%) underperformed. \r\n* Starting with the key M&A news, NVIDIA (NVDA 514.89, +28.31, +5.8%) agreed to acquire Arm Holdings from Softbank for $40 bln in cash and stock; Gilead Sciences (GILD 66.34, +1.44, +2.2%) agreed to acquire Immunomedics (IMMU 83.65, +41.40, +98.0%) for about $21 bln, or $88.00 per share, in cash; and Verizon (VZ 60.32, +0.53, +0.9%) agreed to acquire Tracfone for $6.25 bln in cash and stock. \r\n* Separately, Oracle (ORCL 59.46, +2.46, +4.3%) reportedly formed a partnership with TikToK U.S. after Microsoft's (MSFT 205.41, +1.38, +0.7%) acquisition bid was rejected. Walt Disney's (DIS 131.20, -0.55, -0.4%) ESPN entered into two separate multi-year agreements with Caesars Entertainment (CZR 55.39, +5.28, +10.5%) and DraftKings (DKNG 48.62, +7.16, +17.3%).\r\n* As for today's dose of vaccine news, AstraZeneca (AZN 54.02, +0.29, +0.5%) resumed its COVID-19 vaccine trials in the UK. Pfizer (PFE 37.01, +0.94, +2.6%) for its part reiterated expectations to have conclusive results from its Phase 3 COVID-19 vaccine trial in October while also planning to expand enrollment. \r\n* Citigroup (C 48.15, -2.85, -5.6%) was a notable laggard after its CFO issued a revenue warning and The Wall Street Journal reported that the company could get reprimanded for failing to improve its risk-management systems. Shares of Citigroup fell 5.6%, versus a 1.3% gain in the S&P 500 financials sector. \r\n* The U.S. Treasury market was rather quiet today despite the bullish action in the stock market. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.14%, and the 10-yr yield was flat at 0.67%. The U.S. Dollar Index declined 0.3% to 93.06. WTI crude futures decreased 0.3%, or $0.12, to $37.22/bbl.\r\n* Investors did not receive any economic data on Monday.

I'd honestly appreciate perspectives from both subs."

I'm going to post a list of facts of what is different now than June 11th time frame. We can discuss in comments about how each factor played out in June 11th, and how it will effect the market going forward. My goal here isn't for anyone to come away with the conclusion that bear/bull fukt coz we're all FUKT. The aim of this is to just think about these factors so we can all adjust our yolo's on the fly with information we never absorbed and the bad conclusions that we derived from it\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n1. Early June was the greenest shit ever. I'll never forget premarket Monday June 1st, the entire discussion thread was talking about what color their lexus was gonna be. Calls on anything paid off. HTZ? Sure why not. BK oil company? Sounds green to me. Anything with letters was going to print as long as u bet on it going up, and honestly the worse the outlook the harder that shit was probably going to print. The run up in August was dominated by Apple and Tesla. Late august had random shit like ZM going to the stratosphere, but the \"rotation play\" never came.\r\n2. DIX was posting so many consecutive ridiculously high prints. Lately DIX has been about the lowest it's been this entire bull run from March\r\n3. DXY dropped a lot in Early June, from 5/22 to June 10 it went to 99.86 to 95.96. From 8/21 to now it's gone from 93.25 to 93.27 so it's been flat or whatever\r\n4. Things were more shut down in June than they are now. Reopening now, while piecemeal, really seems like it's going to continue without any rollbacks.\r\n5. In June we were optimistic about a vaccine, but now there are like 10? More vaccines in phase 3.\r\n6. We had another 2 months of PPP and extra federal UI in June. We were optimistic about another stimulus sometime shortly after CARES expired. Now we're about a month past expiry and it's anyone's guess when the next one is coming.\r\n7. Election uncertainty. This is two part. First part is that if we have a split congress who knows if/what future stimulus will look like.\r\n8. 2nd part is that vol futures for October (settles for Nov VIX) has been elevated above September and November for over a year or whatever.  \r\n9. Now the FED changed their stance on inflation and said that they will overshoot in the future as soon as they are able to effectively stimulate inflation."

I bet it’s going to be cumming like my wife's boyfriend by Sept 22.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 companies in play here: TSLA and TSLA’s soon to be meth dealer: LAC.\r\n\r\nWanna make up for those TSLA calls you got crushed on earlier this month?\r\n\r\n**WTF is LAC?**\r\n\r\nIf you’re not dumb, you’ll already know that LAC is a lithium miner, and IMO the one in the best position for success in the near future.\r\n\r\n1. LAC has two mines in the exploration phase, one in Argentina (49% owned, 51% owned by Chinese Li miner Ganfang - this is important for later) and one in Nevada (100% owned)\r\n2. LAC mines brine Li Carbonate (Li C) which should outperform the other major Li miners as they are mining Li Hydroxide (Li H) out of hard rock. The major hard rock suppliers are shutting down mines and have faced regulatory hurdles, setting up undersupply in 2-5 years in the Li market that Li C brine miners can take advantage of as demand creeps up mirroring EV demand.\r\n   1. Li H has a marginal cost of production around $6500/t, with Li hovering around $7000/t it is no longer profitable to extract from hard rock.\r\n   2. Li C mined out of LAC’s Argentine costs $3,576/t and in Nevada, $2,570/t.\r\n3. It is possible to convert Li C to Li H (which is preferred for long range batteries) at a cost ranging between $500/t - $2500/t depending on the composition of the brine.\r\n4. In LAC Bureau of Land Management Application in Nevada the firm lists an in-house Li C to Li H processing facility (huge competitive advantage)... it also lists a BATTERY FACTORY (<- This is where stuff starts to get interesting).\r\n\r\n**LAC and TSLA: A Match Made in Heaven**\r\n\r\n1. Li is an important component in the battery supply chain, if TSLA cannot source Li it cannot build cars. Last year TSLA used approx. 23000 tonnes of Li, costing TSLA approx 300mil.\r\n2. The current agreement TSLA has for a Li supplier expires 21 Sept. 2020 - this agreement is with Ganfang (told you this was important).\r\n3. TSLA is holding a “Battery Day” event on 22 Sept. 2020.\r\n4. TSLA recently acquired Maxwell, a Li-ion battery tech company, confirming Elon’s need for Li.\r\n5. TSLA is looking for US suppliers of Li. One of the few acquisition attempts TSLA has made was to acquire a domestic Li producer Simbol Materials (acquisition failed).\r\n6. The Pentagon has expressed that rare earth mining is vital to national security and should be domestically sourced as much as possible (Li being specifically named as important to national security). China controls the Li market right now, even the spot contract is priced in Yuan. This also makes the regulatory approvals for LAC easier as this is obviously a priority for this administration.\r\n7. LAC’s Nevada mine (which will have a battery processing facility) is only around 3 hours away from the Gigafactory and holds the largest Li reserves in the US (no other mine in Nevada is even able to meet TSLA’s Li needs, where LAC can produce 3x over a 40 year mine life (expected production date in early 2023)).\r\n8. The CTO of LAC, Rene LeBlanc, formerly worked at TSLA as a “Staff Process Development Engineer” where his responsibilities included:\r\n   1. Supporting internal and external teams to identify, track and resolve technical, commercial, and organizational needs\r\n   2. Engage with upstream suppliers to stabilize or improve performance\r\n   3. Analyze market supply and demand to look for opportunities and new promising entrants\r\n9. The CEO of LAC has said that he cannot comment on talks with TSLA, while swallowing a smile, and saying “Tesla knows we are here”.\r\n10. TSLA has been raising money (at market stock offer), perhaps to prep for some acquisitions...?\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**\r\n\r\n… Put the dots together - LAC is a perfect vertical integration opportunity for TSLA in the short term and is overall is very well positioned to take advantage of increased Li demand for EVs in the mid-long term. Further, LAC is trading at around only 4.7x book value and 13 P/E… find that in another EV play.\r\n\r\n**TLDR**\r\n\r\nTSLA is likely to buy / take a stake in the mine / enter a partnership with LAC as their domestic supplier for Li, to be announced Sept 22.\r\n\r\n**Sources**\r\n\r\n[https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR1zNDES1tR0aIUo\\_lEIVEtbATVvUnBL9jWoGa9nXfRm7BMV6WM1cui1rOQ#:\\~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said](https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR0klaeuk3_nDBcPMZJuk25JFgRXRleKqZokJ9GQg1aNoAxjOCaIldOw-SU#:~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said)\r\n\r\n[https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/)\r\n\r\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump\\~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM)\r\n\r\n[https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A](https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A)\r\n\r\n**Positions**\r\n\r\nJacked up to the tits in $13 strike Oct 16 calls (EDIT: on TSX, american options are priced different)"

Further, LAC is trading at around only 4.7x book value and 13 P/E… find that in another EV play.\r\n\r\n**TLDR**\r\n\r\nTSLA is likely to buy / take a stake in the mine / enter a partnership with LAC as their domestic supplier for Li, to be announced Sept 22.\r\n\r\n**Sources**\r\n\r\n[https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR1zNDES1tR0aIUo\\_lEIVEtbATVvUnBL9jWoGa9nXfRm7BMV6WM1cui1rOQ#:\\~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said](https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/article/22026386/chinese-lithium-giant-agrees-to-threeyear-pact-to-supply-tesla?fbclid=IwAR0klaeuk3_nDBcPMZJuk25JFgRXRleKqZokJ9GQg1aNoAxjOCaIldOw-SU#:~:text=Tesla%20will%20designate%20its%20battery,by%20three%20years%2C%20Ganfeng%20said)\r\n\r\n[https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/](https://www.lithiumamericas.com/thacker-pass/)\r\n\r\n[https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump\\~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/video/lithium-americas-ceo-we-ll-make-money-despite-price-slump~1897852?fbclid=IwAR1VXCNVrRN4Dz2bqZc1ncVnCxUVQjkpjZUqMSD7ZHADsykyXGFIbCVkaFM)\r\n\r\n[https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A](https://electrek.co/2016/06/09/tesla-buy-simbol-lithium-startup-325-million/?fbclid=IwAR1BtqoeoBEdyFpiY2zb3k1bSPAXXcVUL4DE8LK4vNxZWbYnmpN6IH-c6-A)\r\n\r\n**Positions**\r\n\r\nJacked up to the tits in $13 strike Oct 16 calls (EDIT: on TSX, american options are priced different)"

              "So here’s the deal. I think everyone already knows about the SoftBank call gamma squeeze. If you don’t, there’s plenty of posts on reddit about it or you can google it. \r\n\r\nHowever, this call gamma squeeze has been happening much longer in Tesla. We know SoftBank only did this in all the tech names in early August. It’s been happening in Tesla for a year. Here’s a post by u/randomness898 describing this 2.5 months ago when Tesla was like half of the current price, split adjusted. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hk7nqe/tesla_infinity_call_gamma_squeeze\r\n\r\nThis obviously worked amazingly for the past year. It hit a recent snag because the 2 things that could not happen happened: Tesla diluted some of its shares in an offering and QQQ sold off. But as long as those 2 aren’t the norm, this play works. \r\n\r\n**So let’s make the assumption tech doesn’t just continue selling off**. Otherwise ignore this post since Tesla will go down with the rest of tech. \r\n\r\nSo we all know there’s a battery day coming up in a few weeks. The options exp on 9/25 + any time later will encompass this event. Now if you go through previous Tesla gamma squeezes, they aren’t the random SoftBank let’s yolo into any tech names squeeze. It’s methodical and calculated, like the guy doing it almost knows what’s going on. Every time Tesla goes up a ton, it coincides with a special event, whether it be good earnings, good sales, profitability achievement, stock split, etc. you name it. Battery day is another potential catalyst. \r\n\r\nNow here’s the kicker. When it squeezes, it really moves. The guy does it so much smarter than SoftBank by layering options along the call skew to essentially create a kurtosis squeeze along with a gamma squeeze, so when it moves we see huge jumps in the stock. \r\n\r\nSTORY TIME\r\n\r\nDid I mention Elon knows options? Freshly posted on 9/10 yesterday. Know any other CEO that knows Black Scholes? Why would any CEO be randomly posting about Black Scholes?\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1303937534595141632\r\n\r\nDo you know the main issue with Black Scholes? It’s that it assumes a lognormal distribution when in reality, stock moves aren’t lognormal. Thus, it *underestimates* jump risk (why everyone in the industry stopped using it after 1987). What’s jump risk you ask? That’s when that OTM call\r\noption goes from 1 dollar to 50 dollars, kinda like all those times in Tesla. \r\n\r\nBut maybe Elon just posted that for fun. I’m probably looking too much into this. Then again, he did post this on 5/1 at 8:11 Pacific Time. The stock split was a 5:1 split on 8/11, so maybe he’s just one of those crazy stable geniuses. \r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239815256797184?lang=en\r\n\r\nEdit: deleted the tldr - u/finna_b_toast"

The Nasdaq Composite declined 2.0%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 1.5%, and the Russell 2000 declined 1.2%. \r\n* The day started with the S&P 500 up 0.8%, and briefly surpassing yesterday's intraday high, on the back of leadership from the mega-caps and growth stocks. The latter might have benefited from an underwhelming weekly initial jobless claims report, which was unchanged at 884,000 (consensus 813,000).\r\n* On no specific news, though, these stocks quickly turned around and the selling carried over to the broad market throughout the day. All 11 S&P 500 sectors finished in red, and 29 of the 30 Dow components finished lower.\r\n* The information technology (-2.3%) and energy (-3.7%) sectors declined more than the S&P 500, while the materials sector (-0.9%) was a relative outperformer. At one point today, the influential tech sector was up 2.6%. \r\n* Some factors that might have pressured sentiment included the inability to sustain yesterday's rebound, suggesting that there was still more selling ahead, and news that the Senate failed to pass its $300 billion coronavirus relief bill. Granted, no one was expecting that bill to get very far, but it reflected the burgeoning pessimism surrounding another relief bill.\r\n* As equities steepened losses throughout the afternoon, money flowed into longer-dated U.S. Treasuries in a safety trade. The 2-yr yield increased one basis point to 0.14%, while the 10-yr yield decreased two basis points to 0.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index advanced 0.2% to 93.41. WTI crude futures fell 2.1%, or $0.78, to $37.27/bbl.\r\n* Bucking the trend today was RH (RH 385.46, +64.38, +20.1%) after the furniture and home accessories company exceeded quarterly expectations.

WTI crude futures fell 2.1%, or $0.78, to $37.27/bbl.\r\n* Bucking the trend today was RH (RH 385.46, +64.38, +20.1%) after the furniture and home accessories company exceeded quarterly expectations. RH shares surged 20% to fresh record highs. \r\n* Looking ahead, investors will receive the Consumer Price Index for August and the Treasury Budget for August on Friday.\r\n\r\n## Index Summary\r\n\r\n**S&P 500 :** (-1.74%);  **NasDaq :** (-2.05%);  \r\n**Russell 2000 :**(-1.3%);  **Dow :**(-1.45%);  \r\n**Vix :**29.71 0.9 (+3.12%)\r\n\r\n## Sector Summary -\r\n\r\n*Three highest sectors for today were -*  \r\n**Materials:** (-0.94%); **Consumer Staples:** (-1.23%); **Industrials:** (-1.28%)  \r\n*Three lowest sectors for today were -*  \r\n**Energy:** (-3.67%); **Information Technology:** (-2.26%); **Utilities:** (-1.72%)  \r\n\r\n\r\n## Commodities/Futures\r\n\r\n(1-day %), \\[5-day %\\], {10-day %}\r\n\r\n***Currency -***  \r\n**USD Index :**93.258 (+0.15%); \\[+0.72%\\]; {+1.26%}; **BC :**10320 (+0.44%); \\[-3.31%\\]; {-12.53%}\r\n\r\n***Precious Metals -***  \r\n**Gold :**1954.9 (-0.05%); \\[+1.36%\\]; {-1.45%}; **Silver :**27.083 (-0.21%); \\[+1.08%\\]; {-4.45%}\r\n\r\n***Farming -***  \r\n**Soybeans :**978.75 (-0.1%); \\[+0.85%\\]; {+2.79%}; **Corn :**360.25 (+1.46%); \\[+5.26%\\]; {+4.88%};  \r\n**Coffee :**128.85 (+0.97%); \\[-3.49%\\]; {+0.23%}\r\n\r\n***Industrials -***  \r\n**Crude :**38.05 (-2.6%); \\[-10.42%\\]; {-13.87%}; **Nat Gas :**2.406 (-4.03%); \\[-7.16%\\]; {-12.44%}  \r\n**Copper :**3.0515 (-2.59%); \\[+0.49%\\]; {-1.95%}\r\n\r\n## Options Fast Facts\r\n\r\n***Total Put/Call Ratio - .74***  \r\n***Highest Multiple Over Daily Average -*** NAV with 13x the ADV of 1370.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5%, while the Nasdaq Composite (-0.6%) and Russell 2000 (-0.7%) closed lower. \r\n* Similar to the days before, today's price action was technically-oriented given the absence of market-moving news and the losses in stocks like Apple (AAPL 112.00, -1.49, -1.3%), Amazon (AMZN 3116.22, -58.89, -1.9%), and Microsoft (MSFT 204.03, -1.34, -0.7%) on no specific corporate news. Apple shares fell 7.4% this week. \r\n* The difference today was that their losses were offset by relative strength in the cyclical sectors, namely industrials (+1.4%), materials (+1.3%), and financials (+0.8%). Still, when Apple and Amazon are down more than 1.0%, there must be more winners than losers to make a meaningful difference. \r\n* There were more of the latter on Friday, as declining issues outpaced advancing issues at the NYSE and Nasdaq. The information technology (-0.8%), consumer discretionary (-0.3%), and communication services (-0.3%) sectors ended the day in negative territory due to their exposure to the mega-cap stocks. \r\n* Interestingly, the S&P 500 was down as much as 0.9% intraday and fell below its 50-day moving average (3322). A broad rebound in the afternoon, however, helped the benchmark index turn positive and close above the key technical level. \r\n* Shares of Oracle (ORCL 57.00, -0.33, -0.6%), Peloton (PTON 84.04, -3.71, -4.2%), and Kroger (KR 34.37, -0.37, -1.1%) finished lower following their earnings reports.

              "Oracle Corp. ORCL +5.49% won the bidding for the U.S. operations of the video-sharing app TikTok, people familiar with the matter said, beating out Microsoft Corp. MSFT +1.90% in a high-profile deal to salvage a social-media sensation that has been caught in the middle of a geopolitical standoff.\r\n\r\nOracle is set to be announced as TikTok’s “trusted tech partner” in the U.S., and the deal is likely not to be structured as an outright sale, the people said.\r\n\r\nThe next step is for the White House and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. to approve the deal, said one of the people, adding that the participants believe it satisfies the concerns around data security that have been previously raised by the U.S. government.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin confirmed that his office received a bid proposal from Oracle for TikTok’s operations over the weekend and said that the Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. would review it this week.\r\n\r\n“We will be reviewing that at the CFIUS committee this week and then will be making a recommendation to the president and reviewing it with him,” Mr. Mnuchin said on CNBC. “From our standpoint, we’ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, that the phones are secure and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams.”\r\n\r\nMr. Mnuchin also said the Oracle deal includes a commitment to establish TikTok as a global company headquartered in the U.S., which he said would mean 20,000 new jobs.\r\n\r\nThe Treasury secretary said he wouldn’t go into all the details of the plan, but clarified that the deadline for the sale of TikTok’s U.S. operations is Sept. 20.\r\n\r\nMORE ON TIKTOK’S BUSINESS\r\n\r\nThe move by TikTok’s parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd., comes days after the Chinese government threw negotiations into doubt when it issued new export restrictions late last month on the kind of artificial intelligence technology TikTok uses. The algorithms, which determine the videos served to users and are seen as TikTok’s secret sauce, were considered part of the deal negotiations up until the Chinese policy change raising questions among the parties involved in negotiations over how to value the social-media business.\r\n\r\nThe structure of Oracle’s deal wasn’t immediately known, including whether it includes transfer of the algorithms.\r\n\r\nTwo people familiar with the Oracle deal said it was more appropriate to call it a partnership, rather than an acquisition, suggesting that there wasn’t an exchange of significant assets. At least some of ByteDance’s existing investors, including U.S. investment firms Sequoia Capital and General Atlantic, will get stakes in the venture as part of the deal, said people familiar with the matter.\r\n\r\nThe possibility that a deal might not involve an outright sale was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal.\r\n\r\nPresident Trump has said repeatedly that he would shut down TikTok in the U.S. if it isn’t sold to an American company. In an Aug. 6 executive order, the White House gave ByteDance a 45-day deadline before it would ban the app, which the Trump administration says poses an economic and national-security threat to U.S. interests, if it isn’t sold to a U.S. buyer.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which had teamed up with Walmart Inc., earlier Sunday said in a statement that it was notified earlier in the day of the decision by ByteDance.\r\n\r\n“We are confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests,” the statement said. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combatting disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.”\r\n\r\nDOES ORACLE’S WINNING BID AVERT A BAN?\r\n\r\nA look at the state of play for the video app’s ownership and the prospects for a deal.\r\n\r\nIn a statement late Sunday, Walmart suggested it is considering joining the Oracle group, saying it is continuing “discussions with ByteDance leadership and other interested parties.”\r\n\r\nWhile China’s recently announced trade restrictions made acquiring TikTok’s algorithm tricky, Microsoft remained committed to acquiring the app’s powerful suggestion algorithms, said a person familiar with the matter. Without outright purchase of the algorithms, Microsoft wouldn’t be able to follow through with its stated commitment to national security issues.\r\n\r\nOracle’s interest in TikTok is primarily driven by kick-starting its fledgling cloud-computing business, which remains far behind market leaders Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft, people familiar with the matter said.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s plans were more ambitious than Oracle, said one person. Owning TikTok would help Microsoft have more presence among everyday consumers, an area it had mostly abandoned to chase after corporate users with the exception of its Xbox gaming business. TikTok would also give Microsoft a treasure trove of data on young and mostly female users, an area it doesn’t have much insight into now.\r\n\r\nThe New York Times reported earlier that Microsoft had been notified of the ByteDance decision.\r\n\r\nTikTok has soared to around 100 million monthly users in the U.S., from about 11 million in early 2018, and they are considered among the most lucrative in the app’s global user base of about 689 million, though the app still loses money.\r\n\r\nOracle wasn’t as obvious a winner in the race for TikTok as Microsoft. While both tech companies have sizable cloud-computing operations and technical capabilities, Oracle is mainly focused on serving business clients and has virtually no experience running a social-media platform or other major consumer-facing business. Microsoft is an even bigger player in business computing but also owns the LinkedIn social-media site and the Xbox videogame business. It also is a much bigger company and has about $136 billion of cash, some three times what Oracle has on hand."

              "I took my car in to a local service center for some regular maintenance. While waiting in line, I overhear the 3 service technicians talking about stocks. All Caucasians for those interested. But nevertheless, piqued, my interest was, of course. I leaned over and started dropping some mad eaves. Fellow 1, let's called him Ball D., was asking Fellow 2, Beardfacè, if he should buy more shares of Tesla and Apple. Before Beardfacè could reply, Fellow 3, Slagathor, chimes in with a \"Hell yea! Now's the time to buy!\" Beardfacè starts talking about how stocks are only going to go up and how he's made so much money that he bought his girlfriend, now fiance, a new shiny rock. And this goes on for some time of Beardfacè and Slagathor convincing Ball D. to add more money with absolutely 0 sentences inserted about fundamentals. To convince him they both opened up their Robinhood accounts and bought more shares. Ball D. fomo's and buys some too right there and then. They then get very excited and Slagathor seals the deal with the following statement \"scared money don't make money.\" \r\n\r\ntl;dr - when idiots start spouting \"scared money don't make money\" to other idiots without understanding anything.\r\n\r\nNow the actual dip that we all fear is probably some time away or tomorrow, who knows. But I've learned now that when you start hearing this sort of talk in public from Joe Shmoe, it's about to get ugly. When scared money enters irrationally, scared money exits irrationally. People will sell with the same exuberance that they bought with. \r\n\r\nComing back to me... I sold all my positions in Apple, Tesla, NVidia, Microsoft, Google, and Boeing. Since the beginning of the year, I've made 200k, with NVDA gaining me 100k of that with a 210% profit. Boeing, made me lose $5000. Which in retrospect, is not at all bad. But I bought it at $170 and sold at $157 (today). Airlines are not going to be recovering anytime soon and buying back in when there are actual orders of planes/profit from BA is plenty opportunity for future gains. \r\n\r\nThe current, metaphorical, well is too deep and you don't know if there's snakes at the bottom. With COVID, back to school/work cases unknown, commercial real estate not making money and people about to get evicted, banks making loans to Joe Shmoe's wife's boyfriend so he can buy a house for you because the Fed printer go brrr, the election, no working vaccines, and a bunch of other macro geopolitical issues, for anyone that actually watches global news -  I'm out. Now, with my earnings, not my savings, I'll buy options for things I know will happen. Like what you say? What happens when Apple reveals a new product? Go ahead and correlate product releases and stock price movement. \r\n\r\ntl;dr - I sold everything, made money, and I'll play options now like a good WSBer. \r\n\r\ntl;dr - I don't risk much and invest very conservatively. As much as I love seeing a 210% gain, that shit don't make any sense and I'm out with some profit until valuations meet MY expectations."

              "I took my car in to a local service center for some regular maintenance. While waiting in line, I overhear the 3 service technicians talking about stocks. All Caucasians for those interested. But nevertheless, piqued, my interest was, of course. I leaned over and started dropping some mad eaves. Fellow 1, let's called him Ball D., was asking Fellow 2, Beardfacè, if he should buy more shares of Tesla and Apple. Before Beardfacè could reply, Fellow 3, Slagathor, chimes in with a \"Hell yea! Now's the time to buy!\" Beardfacè starts talking about how stocks are only going to go up and how he's made so much money that he bought his girlfriend, now fiance, a new shiny rock. And this goes on for some time of Beardfacè and Slagathor convincing Ball D. to add more money with absolutely 0 sentences inserted about fundamentals. To convince him they both opened up their Robinhood accounts and bought more shares. Ball D. fomo's and buys some too right there and then. They then get very excited and Slagathor seals the deal with the following statement \"scared money don't make money.\" \r\n\r\ntl;dr - when idiots start spouting \"scared money don't make money\" to other idiots without understanding anything.\r\n\r\nNow the actual dip that we all fear is probably some time away or tomorrow, who knows. But I've learned now that when you start hearing this sort of talk in public from Joe Shmoe, it's about to get ugly. When scared money enters irrationally, scared money exits irrationally. People will sell with the same exuberance that they bought with. \r\n\r\nComing back to me... I sold all my positions in Apple, Tesla, NVidia, Microsoft, Google, and Boeing. Since the beginning of the year, I've made 200k, with NVDA gaining me 100k of that with a 210% profit. Boeing, made me lose $5000. Which in retrospect, is not at all bad. But I bought it at $170 and sold at $157 (today). Airlines are not going to be recovering anytime soon and buying back in when there are actual orders of planes/profit from BA is plenty opportunity for future gains. \r\n\r\nThe current, metaphorical, well is too deep and you don't know if there's snakes at the bottom. With COVID, back to school/work cases unknown, commercial real estate not making money and people about to get evicted, banks making loans to Joe Shmoe's wife's boyfriend so he can buy a house for you because the Fed printer go brrr, the election, no working vaccines, and a bunch of other macro geopolitical issues, for anyone that actually watches global news -  I'm out. Now, with my earnings, not my savings, I'll buy options for things I know will happen. Like what you say? What happens when Apple reveals a new product? Go ahead and correlate product releases and stock price movement. \r\n\r\ntl;dr - I sold everything, made money, and I'll play options now like a good WSBer. \r\n\r\ntl;dr - I don't risk much and invest very conservatively. As much as I love seeing a 210% gain, that shit don't make any sense and I'm out with some profit until valuations meet MY expectations."

So to those of you that took that approach, I’m sorry if you lost money but I tried to be clear that I’m actually net long and I was worried about a few of you over-leveraged gamblers when I saw that some indicators looked ominous.\r\n\r\n**Disclaimer:** The intellectual content in this post is not mine and comes from Raoul Pal, a brilliant mind in macroeconomics that I’ve learned a lot from.\r\n\r\n**The Baby Boomer Time Bomb**\r\n\r\nThere’s no shortage of conspiracy theories as to why JPOW has taken the most radical steps of any Fed chair ever. In the past few months we’ve seen unprecedented action from powerful institutions and I thought I’d share the most useful perspective I’ve come across in my research so far. So strap on your propeller hat and open a Capri Sun. We’ve got work to do\r\n\r\n**Why Does JPOW print so much?**\r\n\r\n• Baby Boomers (Age 56-74) are one of the largest and most profitable generation the US has ever known\r\n\r\n• In the 70’s, they bid up the demand for goods and services by record numbers\r\n\r\n• That demand created the inflationary environment of the 80’s because they were the first generation to take on enormous amounts of debt to increase their standard of living\r\n\r\n• The popularity of “pension plans” and passive investing soared and gained a huge following with boomers\r\n\r\n• At this same time, credit was made widely available\r\n\r\n• For this reason, the boomers who chose to invest began to accumulate an enormous proportion of equities\r\n\r\n• The average baby boomer is 64 and planning to retire in the next 5 years\r\n\r\n**How do Boomers Affect Me?**\r\n\r\n• The simple truth is the millennials don't have the resources to pay into the system for the sustainment of the retirement plans of the boomer generation\r\n\r\n• There is a huge amount of supply from boomers and very little demand from millennials\r\n\r\n• This is further exaggerated by millennial student debt and the fact that millennials make up a much smaller proportion of the US population than boomers\r\n\r\n• At about 2000 the very first of the baby boomers began to retire and had to drain some of their investments to sustain their lifestyle\r\n\r\n• Every year we’ve seen an increasing amount of baby boomers retiring but based on age, we will start seeing the mass exodus of retirees between 2020-2030 with the peak in the early 2020’s.\r\n\r\n• The issue is most of them can’t afford to retire and maintain their current standard of living because they have too much debt. The wide availability of credit gave the illusion to many that they could afford more than what they really were able to.\r\n\r\n• The estimated amount needed per individual retiree in the US for disposable income is 44,000 a year but the average benefits from US pensions/retirement plans are predicted to only generate 23,000 per year per individual.\r\n\r\n• Assuming life expectancy remains the same, the “average” retiree can afford to drain 9,000 every year from their savings.\r\n\r\n• Therefore your average retiree needs at least 44,000 to meet their yearly needs and only has 31,000 available to do it and the situation is even worse for most boomers because these numbers are heavily skewed by the 1% of boomers that have huge store holds of wealth.\r\n\r\n**Why is JPOW Worried About my Mom?**\r\n\r\n• You may have heard that baby boomers (average age 64) own 46% of US equites, the highest proportion of equities by far when compared to any other generation. The tragedy is it is the top 1% of baby boomers own the majority and most boomers are not in a position to be able to retire.\r\n\r\n• Because retirees are now living longer than ever, they need to stretch the amount they have saved/invested to last longer. This is not their fault at all. The issue is assets that offer more stability such as bonds don’t offer enough return for them to survive.\r\n\r\n• This has led to an ultra-high portfolio concentration (80%) in assets that are considered far more risky like stocks. The baby boomers of today have the highest level of portfolio risk that the world has ever seen.\r\n\r\n• That is at least one reason we have an extremely overvalued market\r\n\r\n• No metric is perfect but the Price/Earnings ratio is the highest in recorded history. So is the market cap /GDP ratio.\r\n\r\n• That means that the recession we are currently in is coinciding with the exact point that the largest amount of baby boomers are beginning to retire. Right now the retirement fund of boomers holds 70% of their net worth and 80% of that is invested in stocks. A crash will utterly destroy their net worth.\r\n\r\n**The Disinflationary Dragon**\r\n\r\n• Retirees normally spend significantly less because they are concerned about stretching their dollar for the rest of their lifespan.\r\n\r\n• This means that at the same time most boomers are selling their stock to fund their daily needs they will be cutting the amount that they are willing to spend on consumer goods.\r\n\r\n• This is a deflationary force and when multiplied by the fact that boomers are the majority of the population that own investments and that they are extremely concentrated in risky assets, we are staring down the barrel of the largest deflationary force in economic history.\r\n\r\n• This is why the Fed wants to “run inflation hot” and take unprecedented action to prop up asset prices. If the Fed lets nature take its course, the baby boomers will see that they are the ultimate bag-holders and will race for the exit, demolishing the hope for retirement of the largest American generation.\r\n\r\n**Summary for my Fellow Glue-Eaters:** The Fed can’t stop Quantitative Easing because if they do, the average 401K and pension will crumble. Millennials can’t afford equities at these ultra-high valuations so there’s not enough demand to combat the tidal wave of supply about to reach shore. When JPOW tried to raise interest rates in 2018, he stopped immediately because he caught his first glimpse of this ugly-ass disinflationary monster. JPOW spends every waking hour of the day printing because when he dreams at night, all he can see are those soulless disinflationary eyes staring back at him. He’s backed into a corner.\r\n\r\n**What does this mean for me?** A lot of you are probably young and willing to take on stupid amounts of risk like me so that you don’t die a slow cubicle death. The truth is I have no idea what asset class offers the most promise for the near future but you can bet your last juicebox that I’m going to keep my eyes open with what JPOW is up to and make posts with what I learn. If you guys have any ideas better than UUP calls for when shit gets froggy someday, let me know. In the mean time, I think having a hedge is not a bad idea.\r\n\r\nGood luck my brothers.\r\n\r\n**TLDR:** Your mom is a bag holder. JPOW is trying to be her white knight because our generation doesn’t have the cash to do it. UUP 26C 12/18/20 as a hedge."

              "$HD a family friend does contracting and construction in NYC. I've been talking to him, he says the past 2 months or so, things like wooden braces, random metal clasps and what not (just basic construction materials for gut renovation of nyc apartments) have been either out of stock, or cost 150% more than the same time last year. The stuff he mentioned was mostly lumber and metal basic materials. He's convinced it has to do with China sanctions. \r\nSpot prices of futures for iron pellets and lumber seemed to already have run up. Honestly, trying understand the global interdepencadies of all this stuff is probably worthless and priced in and there's got to be so much info that I am just not aware of or not looking at. But I'm thinking that big money has been, and might continue going into commodoties ( iron pellets, lumber, soybeans, corn etc) since there seem to be at least some degree of shortages in the US, and may continue to be if trade talks with China fall through/continue to fall through. \r\n\r\nSoybeans are another commodity IIRC we used to get a lot of from China. plenty of soybeans are produce in the US, but in the past decade soybean products have hit supermarkets and are in nearly everything, along with their function in the vegan/vegetarian products, which seems to be a growing market.\r\n\r\nso all in all, I'm wondering if someone with a little more experience with global commodities markets could maybe share some insight. I guess my thesis is that without stable commodity prices, pricing of everyday consumer goods will start to go up. What im unsure about is how it will effect the stock price of companies ike HD/WMT/ etc. if we are starting to see shortages in commodities. \r\n\r\nAnother question is how to gain exposure to lumber / iron / soybean markets through US equities, rather than trading futures, and if that is even worth it/if there are too many more variables added to the equation with trading iron miners, lumber mills, soybean farms .\r\n\r\nI looked into top publicly traded steel and iron producers in the US ( https://www.dividend.com/dividend-stocks/basic-materials/steel-and-iron/#tm=3-industry-stocks&r=ES%3A%3ADividendStock%3A%3AStock%23SID--NYSE&f_2=steel-and-iron&only=meta%2Cdata%2Cthead ) and it doesn't seem like any of them are really following the increase of futures spot price.

I looked at personal loans a few months ago (I have perfect credit) and the rates were way higher.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading, and I apologize if this has been asked before."

And clearly need to up my bets to win big. Bought some 10/9 AAPL 120c when AAPL was around $32 ($15k worth at $15.50 per). Guaranteed to retain some intrinsic value, probably gonna double my money was my thought. Well, ends up I’m not as bulletproof as I thought. My question is, as I slowly recover value, how do I gauge risk of theta decay vs potential upside? What would you do? Looking to learn and also expecting to be roasted because clearly I don’t know shit about this game.\r\n\r\nEdit: Apple at $132. Not $32."

I will continue to look into this case and point out short term trends in an attempt to locate a bottom (if there is one).\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n[Updated TSLA Hidden Bullish Divergence on the Daily chart](https://preview.redd.it/mu9907y07em51.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=77b0e5c7c1ea33b4b16369087c2676c3a2e33045)\r\n\r\nHere we can see that the Bullish divergence play called out yesterday is still intact. TSLA gapped up and closed higher for the 2nd day in a row. The daily candles are fairly bearish right now but lets keep an open mind as I take a closer look.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n[TSLA Hidden Bearish Divergence on the 1 Hour chart](https://preview.redd.it/hu7g3c1e7em51.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f37433272588af4781df8fdfa3679dbabd51ef6)\r\n\r\nTaking a look at the pullback so far, we can see a clear hidden bearish divergence on the hourly chart. This would suggest that this dip is not over yet. I would look for a trend change on this time frame before considering opening a long position. Unfortunately this chart also isnt very telling when asking where TSLA will go next.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\n[TSLA 9\\/8-9\\/10](https://preview.redd.it/7f6vy3ny7em51.png?width=1543&format=png&auto=webp&s=e89b79b088cfcba7e7ad5bf40ed37243c9854c33)\r\n\r\nZooming in on the last 3 trading days I have highlighted the major divergences and Moving average rejections. It can be seen that TSLA bottomed today around the 9/8-9/9 resistance and bounced on a strong bullish divergence. \r\n\r\nLooking towards 9/11, my trading ranges are as follows:\r\n\r\n360-390: Chop, look for divergences to indicate a trend\r\n\r\n\\>390: Bullish, Watch 20dMA break\r\n\r\n<360: Bearish -> 335 retest, watch 50dMA break\r\n\r\n<335: GUH\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nPositions: TSLA 9/11 340 and 330 puts, just to feel something"

The problem with the EMH is that if it were true 100% of the time then there would be no reason to trade actively, because if everything is perfectly priced then there's no return on efforts to play the market outside of long-term plays. This obviously isn't the case.\r\n\r\nSo we know the EMH doesn't hold true 100% of the time. Enter the passive traders, who rely on active traders to price securities fairly when they enter and exit the market. Active traders create value for passive traders by exploiting gaps in the inefficient market to bring securities closer to their fair value. In other words, active traders help make the gears of the market turn through their price pressure on securities.\r\n\r\nDo you know what that makes all of us in WSB?

My first thought was to sell most of the weeklies tomorrow to offset these losses and make up for all the other dumb shit I did today. But then I realized I have no fucking clue how a looming investigation of a company that is almost certainly a fraud top to bottom will impact the stock in a market where most valuations are already bullshit. Tesla got investigated at one point and it didn't matter, but they also never made a video of an engineless Tesla in neutral on a low grade hill like [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAToxJ9CGb8)\r\n\r\nAm I rich now if I hold or am I an idiot for not selling the drop at open?

However do to pressure from numerous sources, (cruise lines, the public/investors, and the governing bodies themselves losing money from the strain coming from the loss of cash flow these cruise lines bring to the cities), the CDC is looking to both save face for waiting too long, as well as mend their relationship with the ones who find them to be responsible for the loss of jobs and money. Which is why they will not only announce the reopening of cruise lines, but make sure to highlight the reason it took so long. Putting emphasis on the fact new special measures needed to be required before opening. And point to Royal Caribbean as an example with their new app and schedule focused on keeping clients safe. Giving them the appearance of the poster child of cruise safety. \r\n\r\nStocks, October 30 calls, or December calls are the play to make. This will also allow for the momentum to carry into the winter (when they make their most money) causing a justified anticipation of great earnings report.

From what i can tell he’s pretty bluntly honest about their standings. I listened to three years of their calls. In the most recent earnings call he also mentions a second product something to do with 4g not much detail out there on this. He also stated these two products are the future of our company.

              "Hi, I'm relatively new to this sub, and I don't know jack shit about trading options, shorting, or margins, but after seeing your shitposts, I'm going to teach you how to build a real retirement portfolio after you YOLO all your gains and are ready for big boy pants. The strategy I've used has allowed me to consistently outperform all indexes, even NASDAQ in recent years (100% gain over past two years, never underperformed). As it relates to building wealth over the long haul there's only one true piece of advice that I have in common with you shits and that's that stonks only go up.\r\n\r\nI'm the head of engineering at our tech company so I’m pretty familiar with the software industry. My strategy is to combine my domain expertise with buy and hold. I dollar cost average into all my positions, and I’m particularly greedy when the market is down. Because my domain expertise is mostly in tech, this generally leaves me over-exposed in that sector. I try to combat against that by buying in some tech-adjacent companies on the consumer side. \r\n\r\nFor example, I am in an industry similar to Square and Shopify, they’re our top competitors, so I buy them. I’m intimate with the makeup of their portfolios, market positioning, and growth opportunities.\r\n\r\nWe chose Zoom and Slack at work, and as I use it extensively and have evaluated the competition as part of our vendor selection process, I can argue that they’re the market leaders in what they do and I understand their pricing models. To dive deeper in this, I also know how much we pay and how much more we would be willing to pay (I make the final decision generally), and I can tell you that these companies haven’t even started cost optimization. There’s a lot of upside after the current high-growth period subsides. Yeah yeah we fucking hate when companies raise prices except when you own the goddamn company. Did you idiots know you can raise prices 10% most of the time and only churn out 2% in the short term? You probably didn't.\r\n\r\nYou autists have domain expertise as well, think about what software your company uses at work, do they have a POS? Do they have a CRM that is specific to your industry? Is there an incumbent that is publicly traded and they're kicking your ass? Do you use a lot of social media, are you an influencer? Maybe you know about the next big social network, or maybe you know that FB isn't going away anytime soon... you guys know shit and don't even realize it.\r\n\r\nAlso, as I stated earlier, my attempt to diversify is by moving into things that are adjacent to my domain expertise which happens to be software. For example, I own a Tesla and purchase clothes from Stitch Fix, and huge consumer of various Disney products and services. Again, I’ve evaluated competitors, and I use the products personally, and I can also argue that my domain expertise gives me a little more insight than the average person on how well software is executed and how much enterprise value that brings the company through innovations such as auto-pilot and the UI/UX of their mobile apps, etc...\r\n\r\nI kinda look at PE but mostly just check revenue growth as a lot of the stocks I buy are from companies that aren't yet profitable.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah I fucking bought Apple, and Amazon before it was cool.\r\n\r\nAfter picking the stocks I don’t go all in. I buy one share or add it to the watch list (dependent upon which brokerage app I use) so I get sense of where it was at a point in time, and by looking each day alongside the rest of my portfolio I get a sense of how it’s changed over time and how they react in relation to my existing portfolio. Then if it dips or goes sideways for a bit, I’ll average in, and then repeat until that stock rises about mid-way in my portfolio by value, then I hold my position there. \r\n\r\nAt this point I don’t sell, I don’t care what happens I laugh at 30% dips and buy more maybe. I just don’t do it UNLESS the stock moons, then I try to sell so one stock doesn’t get too far ahead so I have enough dry powder for more positions. It doesn’t work all the time, sometimes you get something like Google and it just kinda sits there, but over the long haul, it works 9 times out of 10. \r\n\r\nYou can google them but there are studies that show definitively you almost have to try to fail at buy and hold, over periods of 10 years or more , it’s almost impossible as long as you’re not overexposed in two or three companies. People who bought before the dot com bust, or just before the housing bubble, they’re multiples higher today than where they were.\r\n\r\nfuck you guys, I know somehow I'm going to get shit for this post but I think I'm starting to like it here.\r\n\r\nyah I know proof or ban, here's one of my retirement accounts: https://imgur.com/a/VaoT0t4\r\n\r\nTLDR; Buy companies with good products that you use, average in, hold for years and years, sell bits off when they moon or you're over invested in one stock."

For example, I own a Tesla and purchase clothes from Stitch Fix, and huge consumer of various Disney products and services. Again, I’ve evaluated competitors, and I use the products personally, and I can also argue that my domain expertise gives me a little more insight than the average person on how well software is executed and how much enterprise value that brings the company through innovations such as auto-pilot and the UI/UX of their mobile apps, etc...\r\n\r\nI kinda look at PE but mostly just check revenue growth as a lot of the stocks I buy are from companies that aren't yet profitable.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah I fucking bought Apple, and Amazon before it was cool.\r\n\r\nAfter picking the stocks I don’t go all in. I buy one share or add it to the watch list (dependent upon which brokerage app I use) so I get sense of where it was at a point in time, and by looking each day alongside the rest of my portfolio I get a sense of how it’s changed over time and how they react in relation to my existing portfolio. Then if it dips or goes sideways for a bit, I’ll average in, and then repeat until that stock rises about mid-way in my portfolio by value, then I hold my position there. \r\n\r\nAt this point I don’t sell, I don’t care what happens I laugh at 30% dips and buy more maybe. I just don’t do it UNLESS the stock moons, then I try to sell so one stock doesn’t get too far ahead so I have enough dry powder for more positions. It doesn’t work all the time, sometimes you get something like Google and it just kinda sits there, but over the long haul, it works 9 times out of 10. \r\n\r\nYou can google them but there are studies that show definitively you almost have to try to fail at buy and hold, over periods of 10 years or more , it’s almost impossible as long as you’re not overexposed in two or three companies. People who bought before the dot com bust, or just before the housing bubble, they’re multiples higher today than where they were.\r\n\r\nfuck you guys, I know somehow I'm going to get shit for this post but I think I'm starting to like it here.\r\n\r\nyah I know proof or ban, here's one of my retirement accounts: https://imgur.com/a/VaoT0t4\r\n\r\nTLDR; Buy companies with good products that you use, average in, hold for years and years, sell bits off when they moon or you're over invested in one stock."

              "Since early morning yesterday, I have done intense due diligence on Nikola and finally decided to take a position. What principally informed my opinion was the well-written analyst report by Hindenburg. Unfortunately, the report did not contain a strike price and expiration date for options play so I had to come up with it myself, and so;\r\n\r\n# TLDR: Invested ~$5.2k in NKLA $100 call (exp. 01/15/21)\r\n\r\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1vo4a41ymjm51.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac0b2a870f7da90b2cc7a8c2ead28cc4c6c09ec8\r\n\r\nAt the time of this writing, NKLA shares are trading at roughly $31.50, significantly undervalued.\r\n\r\nMy four-pronged investment thesis is below:\r\n\r\n1. **Genius CEO:** The [Hindenburg report](https://hindenburgresearch.com/nikola/) sheds compelling light into the persona and capabilities of Trevor Milton. If the report in its entirety is true, it presents a strong case as to why one should become a long-term investor in Nikola: it proves that Trevor is a genius and able to build a $20B company by rolling a truck down a hill and swindling the world. In fact, I would be more concerned if the report is proven false, because then Trevor becomes just like any other CEO concerned with generating real shareholder value (rather than creatively orchestrating smoke and mirrors). This would make him basic and unappealing.\r\n2. **Strong Revenue Growth:** Nikola has demonstrated [stellar revenue growth](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/05/nikolas-entire-quarterly-revenue-of-36000-was-from-solar-installation-for-the-executive-chairman.html) in 2Q 2020. Specifically, revenue grew from $0 to $36,000 which is an increase of infinity percent, which is remarkable for an emerging growth company. Some people will criticize the fact that this revenue was generated from the installation of solar panels for Trevor Milton, but this is actually a good catalyst for future quarters: Nikola can easily install twice as many solar panels for Trevor and continuously double its revenue. This rate of revenue growth is even more impressive than what some of the best names this year (e.g. FSLY, SE) were able to churn out.\r\n3. **Consistent Shareholder Communication:** Trevor Milton’s transparent communication over Twitter gives him so much accessibility to shareholders. It also ensures that there will be a stream of constant updates from his part, including [important corporate developments](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1304081904677904390). Also importantly, Trevor frequently tweets about important company issues like [shareholding structure](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1285986014691913728?lang=en) and [short interest](https://twitter.com/nikolatrevor/status/1304049295105032199). As someone who doesn’t like to look at financial websites and SEC filings, I very much appreciate hearing about the company’s stock price directly from the CEO.  (Speaking of CEOs, I don't understand why people keep comparing Trevor Milton to Elon Musk - they are not on the same level. I think Trevor's management skills are better compared to those of the CEO/Chairman of GSX, who did a phenomenal job of squeezing his company through uncertainty)\r\n4. **Innovative Pipeline:** People give Nikola a lot of trash because it only has renderings and drawings, but in the 2020 investing climate, this is particularly irrelevant. Nikola was able to capture the hearts and minds of General Motors with just renderings and drawings, proving that pictures and concepts are worth thousands of words (and dollars). I’m looking forward to further illustrations of NKLA’s [upcoming innovative pipeline](https://nikolamotor.com/reckless). If they are good enough, I am willing to overlook the fact that Nikola may never produce a vehicle.\r\n\r\nI hope this DD is helpful. Please post any questions you may have."

I can once again stare at my phone and watch all of my allowance evaporate into thin air!\r\n\r\nWhat shocked me was when I opened my robinhood app the lines and numbers had this odd blue/yellow color instead of the scary red I'm used to and semi comforted by.\r\n\r\nI looked it up and it turned out this strange color is called grEen....\r\n\r\nSo confused by this change I started to scroll through my number list to see why exactly my numbers are going up instead of down.\r\n\r\nThere is a set of letters called immu, I don't remember the full name of the company because it's alot of letters that make some fancy word and they try to fix cancer ♋.\r\n\r\nAnyway they went up like a hundred percent today and that doesn't happen for me. I don't make money off the stock market. I just put numbers by the places and watch my money go away.\r\n\r\nSo long story short I don't know how to do options because they are scary and grandma will haunt me if I loss all her money all at once but if I did do options I'd say immu is gonna go down really hard. \r\n\r\nCause once again I don't make money off this robinhood shit I just play with it like a videogame and unless immu just found the cure for covid and cancer and patented that shit there is no way I was lucky enough that one of my stocks doubled in value and is gonna stay that way."

              "I tried positing this last week but apparently DD was the wrong flair and I got myself banned temporarily. I think it will still be useful to people here though.\r\n\r\nLike many of you here, I have enjoyed watching $TSLA attempt to overtake Elon's Roadster on its way to Mars over the last few months. From what I've been reading here, it seems like at least 1/2 of the basis for the rise is speculation about what Tesla is going to reveal on \"Battery Day.\"\r\n\r\nI don't have insider knowledge, but I am a baby scientist (AKA PhD student) in a group that ~~fucks with batteries~~ works in this space, so I think I might have some useful perspective on what we can expect.\r\n\r\n>**\"Million Mile Battery\"**\r\n\r\nAfter watching the stock price go up to $2000 pre-split, I was seriously considering the possibility that people thought \"million mile battery\" meant that Tesla is about to announce a car with a range of 1,000,000 miles. On YouTube people are speculating about range increases to 600 miles, which I think is almost certainly not going to happen. My guess is the Model 3 and Model Y will not be produced with ranges exceeding even 400 miles for at least the next 2-3 years. Why? Batteries are still expensive and will be for a while. Companies can reduce EV prices significantly by not including range than consumers don't need. 300 miles is the sweet-spot that Tesla targets for their mass-production vehicles and I really don't expect that to change any time soon.\r\n\r\nSo what is a million mile battery then? A battery that can be recharged N times with limited degradation where N = 1,000,000/range. This is important if Telsa actually figures out how to do Level 5 autonomous driving (e.g. full self driving) and instantly turns on the option to have your Tesla Model 3 drive around and take other people on rides as a robotaxi. Those cars would be driving all day, every day so their batteries would be shot within a few years at current degradation rates.\r\n\r\nHowever, while this certainly would be a significant milestone in battery development, we've been expecting this for years. It is HIGHLY unlikely that they announce something that will blow the minds of anyone who knows about batteries, especially the big producers like Panasonic, LG Chem, etc.\r\n\r\nI have no inside knowledge, but I've been paying attention to the state of the art in Li-ion batteries for a few years. Here is what I think is likely that Tesla will announce:\r\n\r\n* More stable battery chemistry with reduced degradation rates, probably enough for Tesla to declare the \"million mile battery\" achieved. Tesla's production partner CATL has already announced this. [Link](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a32801823/million-mile-ev-battery-pack-revealed/)\r\n* Cathodes with less cobalt that are cheaper to make, in general.\r\n* Tabless electrodes (makes batteries more efficient) which is actually what is pictured in the announcement background photo that people were speculating was Si nanowires. [Link](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/ihcfe0/the_battery_day_teaser_is_not_silicon_nanowires/)\r\n* Some kind of roadmap to achieve 5% improvements in energy density/year. This will lead to a 30% reduction in cost over a period of about 5 years, which equates to a \\~$7,000 decrease in the cost of manufacturing each car. They could either pass this savings to the consumers with a price decrease or they could increase their profit margins and reinvest that money back into R&D (more likely based on how Telsa operates.)\r\n* A roadmap to significantly increasing battery production.\r\n\r\nI would be so psyched if they totally blow us away with something revolutionary like putting a Li-metal anode in production (instant \\~50% improvement in energy density) because I'm long Planet Earth. However, knowing how incremental the Li-ion battery development process is, I just don't think that's in the cards right now, unfortunately.\r\n\r\nPositions: 5x $84p 1/15/21I bought these before I realized that this run up has nothing to do with fundamentals or science. Edit: DO NOT MIRROR THIS POSITION IF YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MONEY. I will probably close it once the right time comes (I should have done so on Friday)\r\n\r\nIf you have a different take, I would love to hear it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR Don't get your hopes up too high for Battery Day. Tesla will announce better batteries and production, but probably nothing that will catch the whole EV industry off guard."

This is a healthy correction but of course when we're so fucking leveraged with short exp calls it feels like the apocalypse. \r\n\r\nLet's take a quick look at June 8th. SPY had a face ripping rally of roughly 30% from the previous 3 months. It was a steady climb up with a few dips a long the way. The drop off from June 8th was about 8% over a week. This is widely considered as a healthy correction. This wasn't followed by another rally. No, this is where the Kangaroo market was formed. AMD was trading like KO hovering in the $50's and theta gang was taking Bulls and Bears lunch. \r\n\r\nAfter a couple of weeks of this consolidation we started the bull run that was more rigged than Tim Donaghy officiating NBA games. SPY went up 18% in about 2 months with almost no dips along the way. Similar to June 8th, SPY drops about 8% in a week. Again, a healthy correction. Will this be followed by another 18% rally? Probably not. We'll have some big green and red days sprinkled in here and there in the next week or so. But theta is coming from the top ropes to kick our ass. \r\n\r\nThere was no major catalyst for this sell off that points to another market crash. Soft bank, tech bubble, elections, etc. All valid arguments but this is still normal compared to a sell off caused by a pandemic. Everyone one wants to be the next Michael Burry, Bill Ackman, and Bobby Axelrod. So keep buying those far OTM puts if you'd like, but the fed will not let SPY drop to $300. Mr. Pump won't let it either. \r\n\r\nWe've all gotten bear raped this last week and it hurts. Now's the time to learn to play both sides and start hedging. Having your account wiped out fucking sucks. I'm down 50% this month and I'm sure not letting myself get to 100%. Buy spreads, leaps, and wait for the storm to clear up a bit. \r\n\r\nMy positions are:\r\n\r\n AAPL 01/15 $130C \r\n\r\nSQQQ 10/16 $30C\r\n\r\n$WMT 01/15 $150C\r\n\r\nFeel free to roast me, inverse me, and tell me I'm wrong.

Not advice or offer to sell securities. \r\n\r\nBioNTech and Moderna will be dominating the news cycle in October. Both companies should be able to report their interim results for early approval by mid October. Covid was the biggest news of Spring and Summer; vaccine will become the biggest news topic of fall. Odds of a vaccine that is in Phase 3 trials gaining approval is 85%. Odds of one of two gaining approval is calculated as follows (1-(1-0.85)\\^2=0.9775). So essentially 98%. This doesn't factor in any exogenous factor that affects approval of both vaccine (eg. rouge FDA officer, political pressure, Media, ...). Early use authorization bring in its own complexities and risks. This should be essentially the only hurdle to approval. It's hard to estimate the risk of early approval. My wild guess is 10-20% risk due to politics. Sadly vaccine approval will become politicised. \r\n\r\nA note about Astrazeneca: They were in the lead but they started their US arm of study too late. Suffered 1.5 setbacks with demyelination. For practical reasons I consider the odds of them applying and gaining early approval to be low and not worth considering. This is essentially a wild card. \r\n\r\nA note about Novavax: has the best vaccine in terms of storage and ease of administration. They are in Phase 2 and will win big if frontrunners falter. \r\n\r\nI expect markets to start moving before companies report that they have their interim results.

              "Before the pandemic I was a regular poker room patron at MGM National Harbor. They shut down for months but just recently reopened, and more recently opened their poker room back up to the general public.\r\n\r\nNow before the pandemic, MGM National Harbor was always packed pretty much 24/7. It’s one of their newer properties and definitely the nicest casino in the DMV area (only other options locally are shitty and older Maryland LIVE and some places in West Virginia you don’t want to go to). \r\n\r\nI arrived there last night at 9 PM, which normally would be prime time. Definitely not hoppin’ like it used to be. High roller table games were mostly empty. The slots were operating at maybe 50% max capacity because every other one was turned off to allow distance between the players, but it was very noticeable that even with the reduced number operating most were not being used. \r\n\r\nThey installed hand washing stations throughout the property around all the games but honestly I barely saw anyone using them which was not good. Face masks are mandatory, but they make you pull down your mask when you enter the casino area and take a picture of your face. All dealers for table games and poker wear plastic face shields. There are plexiglass dividers between dealers and players on most table games, but the side effect of that is definitely less players per table than normal. Spectators are no longer allowed to hang around, you’re only allowed to be at the table if you’re playing. The lack of spectators will have a dampening effect on the enthusiasm of players at certain table games. In fact, the whole energy of the casino was low. Imagine playing craps with no spectators. \r\n\r\nDidn’t seem like they could be selling as much alcohol, the lobby and casino bars had earlier closing hours and at 9 PM on a Saturday I was able to walk up to any of the open bars and get a drink immediately, no long lines like the good old days.\r\n\r\nThe only section of the casino that was more active than usual was the race book which was odd because usually that’s only at half capacity at best when I’ve been in the past.\r\n\r\nAs for my poker experience, it was interesting. They removed about 25% of the tables they used to have on the floor to allow for distancing, and it’s now maximum 7 players to a table instead of 9. You do the math, they are definitely not making nearly as much off the poker room as they used to be able to. Plus, with 7 players instead of 9 and the lengthy swap out process for players who get knocked out (an attendant has to come and sanitize the seat for you and it took a long time) there were more hands than usual that were played with a reduced rake because there were less than 5 players active. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, because of the reduced seat capacity the wait list for the 1-3 tables (the most popular) took hella long and people were giving up on the wait and leaving. Also it was very apparent that the higher blind tables were much less in demand, they barely had any waits and that would be unheard of pre-pandemic. That means that the poker players showing up there intend to put less money on the table now. \r\n\r\nThe poker playing experience is still good if it’s what you like, I was able to enjoy myself despite all the plexiglass alienation. However I don’t know how long they can run this poker room without a COVID-19 case eventually being traced to it, because despite all the effort of distancing and sanitization, they still don’t have a good solution for keeping the chips themselves clean. Unless you neurotically sanitize your hands every time you rake chips, which I guess you could but most people weren’t/won’t, you’re at risk. I played for at least three hours and never saw any type of sanitation of the chips. The only solution I can think for this would be if you had contactless betting where you are separated from your stack, you verbalize your bets and the dealer moves everybody’s chips for them. That would be a big hassle for the dealer and I don’t think players would like it at all but I don’t know how else you could otherwise reduce that risk.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - I have no MGM position and don’t intend to open one but I think there’s going to be a rude awakening when ER comes around because people have been piling back into MGM like everything is back to normal. Just because MGM has reopened its properties does not mean it’s anything like it was before. They are operating with many handicaps that will make it literally impossible to achieve anything near pre-pandemic earnings, and this is not going to change any time soon. I also think it’s highly likely they will run into trouble when a COVID-19 case is officially traced to their properties from a gamer that handled chips."

Spectators are no longer allowed to hang around, you’re only allowed to be at the table if you’re playing. The lack of spectators will have a dampening effect on the enthusiasm of players at certain table games. In fact, the whole energy of the casino was low. Imagine playing craps with no spectators. \r\n\r\nDidn’t seem like they could be selling as much alcohol, the lobby and casino bars had earlier closing hours and at 9 PM on a Saturday I was able to walk up to any of the open bars and get a drink immediately, no long lines like the good old days.\r\n\r\nThe only section of the casino that was more active than usual was the race book which was odd because usually that’s only at half capacity at best when I’ve been in the past.\r\n\r\nAs for my poker experience, it was interesting. They removed about 25% of the tables they used to have on the floor to allow for distancing, and it’s now maximum 7 players to a table instead of 9. You do the math, they are definitely not making nearly as much off the poker room as they used to be able to. Plus, with 7 players instead of 9 and the lengthy swap out process for players who get knocked out (an attendant has to come and sanitize the seat for you and it took a long time) there were more hands than usual that were played with a reduced rake because there were less than 5 players active. \r\n\r\nOn top of that, because of the reduced seat capacity the wait list for the 1-3 tables (the most popular) took hella long and people were giving up on the wait and leaving. Also it was very apparent that the higher blind tables were much less in demand, they barely had any waits and that would be unheard of pre-pandemic. That means that the poker players showing up there intend to put less money on the table now. \r\n\r\nThe poker playing experience is still good if it’s what you like, I was able to enjoy myself despite all the plexiglass alienation. However I don’t know how long they can run this poker room without a COVID-19 case eventually being traced to it, because despite all the effort of distancing and sanitization, they still don’t have a good solution for keeping the chips themselves clean. Unless you neurotically sanitize your hands every time you rake chips, which I guess you could but most people weren’t/won’t, you’re at risk. I played for at least three hours and never saw any type of sanitation of the chips. The only solution I can think for this would be if you had contactless betting where you are separated from your stack, you verbalize your bets and the dealer moves everybody’s chips for them. That would be a big hassle for the dealer and I don’t think players would like it at all but I don’t know how else you could otherwise reduce that risk.\r\n\r\nTL;DR - I have no MGM position and don’t intend to open one but I think there’s going to be a rude awakening when ER comes around because people have been piling back into MGM like everything is back to normal. Just because MGM has reopened its properties does not mean it’s anything like it was before. They are operating with many handicaps that will make it literally impossible to achieve anything near pre-pandemic earnings, and this is not going to change any time soon. I also think it’s highly likely they will run into trouble when a COVID-19 case is officially traced to their properties from a gamer that handled chips."

But it all started when I got promoted at my job and I was expected to make 40k that year so I had room for a new vice. Hence came the night we went out as a group to the best place a man can go Guh his money into oblivion the CASINO. \r\n \r\nThe first night there I remember the hype, the girls, the lights, and just a complete party that never ends. It didn’t start a in one blow it was a gradual bleed. The kind of bleed where you have to contemplate whether or not you should get stitches or not or just a straight intervention! But in one year I lost 8k by financially banging my head against a concrete wall thinking if I just believe then maybe just maybe I can become a winner but the only way you can win at place where the odds are against you, is being a good loser.\r\n\r\nAnd I know a lot of you are starting think hmm you are starting to sound like a gay bear 🐻 lover but I’m not hoe bags. I’m here to give the sauce; the sauce melange. You wanna become successful at this shit?!. You wanna skateboard a SpaceX rocketship str8 to the fucking moon where you would land upon the throne that is a testament to All of your gain porn!? Then you need to treat Wall Street like the Slut baggery it is, you need to treat Wall Street like your the Casino. 2:1 boys and girls! \r\n\r\nYou don’t believe me!? Try this you degenerates a take a quarter and a pen and pad and you will flip this coin 100 times. Every time it lands on heads you add a +2 and -1 when it lands on tails and see your results. A lot of Yolo yourself too much and end crying like baby meat soy boys. I’d like to tell you this is you are down 10 percent and you don’t pull out you need some stonks therapy in this shit. This is grown man shit right here boys/girls if you don’t take the bull by the horns it will turn you into a gay bear 🐻🌈."

Me too!\"  And when I heard it was Hydrogen  powered, I closed that book. Anyone who's done the energy equation on  hydrogen power knows it's not a compelling technology.\r\n\r\nBut,  NKLA surprised me. It's no small feat to get a company listed on the  exchange. Maybe there's something happening here after all.\r\n\r\nI'm  sure we've all heard the joke about the guy who looks at his loser son  and realizes he has to do something. So he calls Bill Gates and says,  \"your daughter is going to marry my son.\"\r\n\r\nBill gates says, \"No she's not.\"\r\n\r\nSo the man says, \"But he's the president of the world bank.\"\r\n\r\nBill says, \"ok.\"\r\n\r\nThen the man calls the world bank and says, \"My son is going to be the president of the world bank.\"\r\n\r\nThey say, \"No he's not.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the man says, \"But he's married to Bill Gates' daughter.\"\r\n\r\nSo the world bank says, \"ok.\" And everyone lived happily ever after.\r\n\r\nI  can't help but wonder if Trevor has something like that going on with  NKLA.

No one gets anything when they collect a majority share of SonicCoin or whatever dumb fucking thing you lost your money in back then. These are the strongest companies in the world that the whole economy has relied on to get thru this pandemic. They will forever be more valuable than they were before the pandemic because we need them.\r\n\r\n    Stop falling for traps that make you sell your position for half what you bought it for. Stop buying puts without a catalyst. Seriously we are about to be hit with the craziest inflation and your dumb ass thought stocks were going to go down? Stop listening to your bear advisors. They are wrong all the time. I bet you Chad pays those scarecrows so you dummies are dumb enough to sell at any sight of red. Learn to buy long calls and if you wanna eat some FD do your God damn due diligence and use bankroll management. \r\n   \r\nThis 3 day crash should not have killed as many as it did. If you lost all your money these past 3 days, then about to lose some more money cause you bought puts, your dumb ass needs to listen to episode 1 of confessions of a market manipulator. No im not going to link it for you. The episode will tell you exactly how you got played for all your money this past week. And don't listen to 5 minutes and think you got it. Thats why your losing right now. You think you know something others don't. But really thats just you trying to feel better about all the dd your dont do. Now go do something smart and buy the god damn dip."

But honestly I could give a shit less. \r\n\r\nNormies don’t look at that. Normies see the “intel core” sticker and they’re sold. They have blind faith because they recognize the brand. To be honest if these companies weren’t something I paid attention to I probably would have never even known that AMD is “beating” Intel. Intel’s core customers know that and that’s why I don’t think Intel is going to lose much more market share to AMD. Maybe they’ll gain the super dedicated gamers and computer enthusiasts that care about that level of performance. But I don’t think they represent the vast majority of tech consumers. The average tech consumer doesn’t give a rats ass. They know Intel so they trust Intel. \r\n\r\nDon’t believe me? \r\n\r\nAsk anyone that doesn’t trade/ is a computer enthusiast if they know who INTEL is. Then ask them who AMD is. I’m certain they’ll only recognize one. \r\n\r\nAMD just doesn’t have the same level of brand recognition. \r\n\r\nThe recent Tech “crash” dragged intel back to a PE of 9. Meanwhile AMD is chilling at around 160. I find it hard to believe that somehow even though INTC has 10 times the revenue, and retains around 30% if that into NET income (where AMD is at was most recently at a wimpy 8%) that its valued far below AMD. Big fish have been eyeing it. Vanguard bit this quarter. \r\n\r\nOn top of that the recent acquisition of Mobileye should catch the attention of you Daddy Musk littles and NIO SIMPS (I don’t blame you for throwing your life savings at them their cars do look sexy af) As you probably don’t know the original version of TSLA autopilot ran on Mobileye. Daddy Musk got cocky and advertised the self driving system as being far more autonomous that it was which after a crash cause Mobileye to pull out of their deal with TSLA. If you ask TSLA it’s because mobileye was unhappy with TSLA taking over some aspects of production. Either way that spells a smart business because they were either avoiding lawsuits or defending their right to their technology. That doesn’t change the fact that they were Tesla’s first choice and for good reason. \r\n\r\nMusk is now arguing against the use of a Lidar system saying that “anyone relying on Lidar is doomed”, but Mobileye disagrees. So does Cornell. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.google.com/amp/s/arstechnica.com/cars/2019/08/elon-musk-says-driverless-cars-dont-need-lidar-experts-arent-so-sure/%3famp=1\r\n\r\nThe gist is a camera only system is bound to fail in certain environments and also performs worse in poor lighting. Ultimately if we’re going to have fully self driving cars they’re going to need to be able to function in all types of environments including the roads of India and China which is a task that Mobileye is already successfully undertaking. \r\n\r\nMobileye’s customers include Nissan, Volkswagen, Cadillac, BMW and NIO. Most of which have agreed to share driving data with Mobileye, which puts them at a massive advantage compared to TSLA. Ultimately a camera only system is bound to eventually fail and in a society that is already skeptical about the safety of autonomous cars. \r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the degenerates that call themselves analysts INTC has at most a 9% downside if it touches the historical low PEs of 7. But it also has a potential 100% upside. AMD on the other hand could drop all the way down to $8 and still have a higher price to earnings than Intel. But as you already know the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.\r\n\r\nIntel has been more efficient with their money, they have real brand recognition that I highly doubt AMD will ever achieve. Oh and they’re currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. \r\n\r\nDon’t trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside\r\n\r\nIntel isn’t a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.\r\nIf it dips lower I’m going I’m going to add leaps on top of my existing position. \r\n\r\nDo your own DD-this isn’t advice-but remember, I’m right you’re wrong; say hi to the wife for me.\r\n\r\nPositions: INTC 47.5 11/20C"

Oh and they’re currently brining in like 10 times more tendies than AMD. They have a massive economic Moat while AMD barely has one. \r\n\r\nDon’t trade on emotions trade on fact. And the fact is Intel has a bigger potential upside\r\n\r\nIntel isn’t a fast mover, at these levels it still has a potential downside because the whole sector is shaky but that will only create better buying opportunities.\r\nIf it dips lower I’m going I’m going to add leaps on top of my existing position. \r\n\r\nDo your own DD-this isn’t advice-but remember, I’m right you’re wrong; say hi to the wife for me.\r\n\r\nPositions: INTC 47.5 11/20C"

              "Alright my favorite group of aspies let's talk real estate and why you should give a shit.  For reference I'm going on 7 years as a full time agent (also down 7k on options cause im a paper handed bitch).  This is not financial advice and I don't currently have any holdings to shill you (cash gang).\r\n\r\nReal estate correlates so strongly with rates it might as well just be tied to it.  There's a feeding frenzy in residential right now because of low rates and zero inventory.  Also, in residential real estate you can get so much leverage that it makes your margin accounts look like a flaccid dick on Friday night.  We talking 96.5 % Loan to Value.\r\n\r\nAside from low interest rates and general covid fear. There's pretty low inventory across the board cause Donny isn't allowing foreclosures through the end of the year at least on the Fed backed paper.  This means banks can't take grandmas home and sell it until the end of March give or take.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand Commercial lease contracts are usually years long and are still on-going and most corporate businesses have probably been paying their landlord.  There will be a swath of small businesses going BK and exiting smaller leases.  This is a given.\r\n\r\nLow inventory high prices.  Thank you college.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when the moratorium on foreclosures +90 days passes.  Banks going to take back grandma's home and sell it at the market.  Increasing inventory.  With low interest rates this is fine.  There's fairly good buying power in middle class America to keep residential more stable (relatively).  More importantly you buy residential real estate based on your personal income.\r\n\r\nWhat happens when commercial leases start expiring and corporate America doesn't care if you watch porn and move pixels around at home as long you do whatever you do well enough to not make your boss look bad.  They don't renew their lease, take substantially smaller space, or take space at a reduced rate.  Increasing inventory of leases.  Lower rents and top line goes down for commercial landlords.  Now the critical difference here is that the great majority of commercial assets rely upon cash flow to determine value of the asset and qualify for the loan. So commercial asset prices start to come down to meet the new and reducing demand for commercial space.  This now means a ton of more recent acquisitions in commercial are underwater and paying fairly high interest rates 4% - 6% with LTVS closer 65% and often much shorter term notes.  So the owners have to decide quickly whether to pay a higher rate with less income or bail on the asset and take the equity they have left.  Tough choice since its not a 30 year amortized fixed at 3.2%.\r\n\r\nOn the high end I bet commercial real estate takes a cut as high as 35% within 36 months.\r\n\r\nI'd personally consider buying REITs after there is further downward correction on real estate.\r\n\r\ntldr: commercial reits are going to have a bad time\r\n\r\nConsidering rolling savings into PSTH.U and just forgetting about it.  All feedback welcome and will reply as I am able."

I press some more buttons and pray things get better today.\r\n\r\nAfter I shower and get dressed, I press the button to call an elevator to take me down from my 15th floor condo to the street level where a Starbucks resides. I order a pumpkin spice latte and the nice young woman presses some buttons to inform the barista of my order. I then stick my card in a machine and press some buttons to pay for it.\r\n\r\nOn the way back up to my condo, I press some more buttons on my pocket screen to check up on my earlier button pressing. It's worse now. I press some more buttons to make the bleeding stop.\r\n\r\nI logon to my work screen and press some buttons to dial into a teleconference committee of like 30 people. Half of us discuss process and procedures for button pressing that will impact several thousand peoples' button pushing activities. The other half (myself included) are distracted with other button pressing.\r\n\r\nMy boss messages me asking why the numbers are down. He seems angry. I grab some data, press some buttons, and explain to him what happened. I then tell him which people should press what buttons to make the numbers go back up. He is now happy. They pay me 6 figures a year to do this. I look at my non-work screen and get angry as I see where that money is going.\r\n\r\nLater today, when I am done pressing the buttons on my work screen, my non-work screen, and my pocket screen, I'll head to my microwave and push some more buttons, then to the couch and push different buttons. Once the sun has set and I am tired, I will push the button that makes the big screen stop. Before going to sleep, I will check my pocket screen one last time and gaze into the future. The numbers will still be down.\r\n\r\nI never know which buttons to push to make them go back up.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEdit:  I am not even joking. I literally just described the exact events of my day to that point. This is not a meme, but an existential cry for help.\r\n\r\nPositions:  PFE leaps, SLV Leaps, VXX day trading"

It's worse now. I press some more buttons to make the bleeding stop.\r\n\r\nI logon to my work screen and press some buttons to dial into a teleconference committee of like 30 people. Half of us discuss process and procedures for button pressing that will impact several thousand peoples' button pushing activities. The other half (myself included) are distracted with other button pressing.\r\n\r\nMy boss messages me asking why the numbers are down. He seems angry. I grab some data, press some buttons, and explain to him what happened. I then tell him which people should press what buttons to make the numbers go back up. He is now happy. They pay me 6 figures a year to do this. I look at my non-work screen and get angry as I see where that money is going.\r\n\r\nLater today, when I am done pressing the buttons on my work screen, my non-work screen, and my pocket screen, I'll head to my microwave and push some more buttons, then to the couch and push different buttons. Once the sun has set and I am tired, I will push the button that makes the big screen stop. Before going to sleep, I will check my pocket screen one last time and gaze into the future. The numbers will still be down.\r\n\r\nI never know which buttons to push to make them go back up.\r\n\r\n&#x200B;\r\n\r\nEdit:  I am not even joking. I literally just described the exact events of my day to that point. This is not a meme, but an existential cry for help.\r\n\r\nPositions:  PFE leaps, SLV Leaps, VXX day trading"

Old boy, good pup, went peacefully. \r\n\r\nTonight I received this from my mom-\r\n\r\n“Yesterday, after Arthur died, I received a delivery for some over-the-counter medicine from Chewy that had been ordered earlier.  We obviously no longer needed it, so I went to their chat line and explained the situation. I asked if I could return the item unopened and be credited for it ($60).\r\n\r\nThey said, \"We are so sorry!  We will credit the amount back to your credit card. And please do not bother to return it. Just donate it to someone who could use it.\"\r\n\r\nI thought that was so nice of them. They did not have to do that.\r\n\r\nBut then today came a knock at the door. It was a delivery of flowers. The card was signed, \"we are so sorry to hear of your loss of Arthur, and our hearts go out to you. We know this time is tough, and we are always here if you need anything. Love, Arianna from Chewy.com\"\r\n\r\nThey sent me flowers...\r\n\r\nOrder from this company. What amazing people.”\r\n\r\n——\r\n\r\nThey just got a customer for life, and probably the 18 of us on the group text she sent this to. \r\n\r\nAny company that operates like this has the customer retention and margins to win their market long term. \r\n\r\nCalls on Chewy\r\n\r\nEDIT: Thanks guys, y’all are awesome.  \r\nObviously, please don’t actually take this as a reason to buy calls before QE tomorrow. It would suck if I found out any of you bought calls just to get IV crushed after earnings. Really I just wanted to share this in the place and with the people with whom I spend the most time. I know we are not the only family to lose a pet, and I know we are not the only ones they sent condolences. I still think it’s a classy move, even if it’s a tactical one to win customers’ hearts and minds. In this case, they were Spot on. I don’t mind being fought for.\r\n\r\nEdit2: no I’m not a PR person. Stop asking.\r\n\r\nEdit3: people who have done actual DD on Chewy, please feel free to comment as some of you have for others who are considering a long or short position"

I think I found another good potential…\r\n\r\n Forum Merger II (NASDAQ:FMCI), however, seems to have already found a compelling merger target with explosive growth, expanding profitability, and a modest valuation. That target? Ittella International, a plant-based food company that's quickly expanding its popular Tattooed Chef brand.c Tattooed Chef is a vegan food brand featuring items such as enchilada bowls, cauliflower wings and burgers, smoothie bowls, and much more. It grows its own organic vegetables in Italy and hand-prepares its items to sell at grocers like Walmart and Costco Wholesale. Importantly, its foods are all able to be frozen, offering grocers more flexibility with supply and expiration.\r\n\r\nThe brand is owned entirely by Ittella International. Upon completion of the merger the combined entity -- Forum Merger II and Ittella International -- will officially change its name to Tattooed Chef and focus solely on Tattooed Chef-branded sales. Ittella International was able to grow to $32.5 million in sales in its first eight years of existence. Not bad. Since focusing predominately on Tattooed Chef-branded sales and on plant-based foods in 2017, it has enjoyed a supercharged compound annual growth rate of 61.7%, with $222 million in sales estimated next year. That rate comfortably paces 55.4% growth for key competitors like Beyond Meat. Tattooed Chef's brand clearly drove sales growth for the company as a whole. Furthermore, it shifted the focus from the private-label foods Ittella had been mainly featuring, to selling only items with the branded Tattooed Chef label. In 2018, private-label sales represented 94% of its revenue. Today, that number has fallen to 37%, with branded sales making up 63% of company revenue. Developing and focusing on branded sales comes not just with inherently higher margins, but also with increased brand loyalty There are no signs that Tattooed Chef's brand momentum is slowing. Currently, the label is in just 7% of Walmart stores. CEO Sarah Galletti expects that number to rise to 50% by year's end, extending the Tattooed Chef brand to thousands of additional stores. . Galletti also sees regional grocery chains as another natural avenue for expansion. Based on the company's early success in Walmart, it's reasonable to think Galletti will find success with smaller chains as well.With an expected enterprise value (EV) of $482 million, Tattooed Chef will debut on public markets trading at 2.2 times sales versus 13.2 times sales for Beyond Meat. Its forward EV/EBITDA is far lower than Beyond Meat's at 15.6 times versus 126.8 times. Tattooed Chef is an extremely rare case of a company outshining a direct competitor in all three key areas: growth, profitability, and value. \r\n\r\nhttps://www.fool.com/investing/2020/08/16/this-plant-based-meat-company-is-more-worth-the-ri/\r\n\r\nEveryone thinks the company is going to announce the merger in October and the IPO.\r\n\r\nIm in the Jan15  $25c (15) and (5) $30c.

We’ll grab a handful of your last good boy points and put on your helmet because I’ve got a trading strategy that’ll rip your tits off going hypersonic to tendie town. \r\n\r\nStep 1: Close your 9 tabs of sonic the hedgehog porn and open up any major market monitoring website. I’m not talking about your E*TRADE or TD AMERITRADE accounts. Especially the short bus riders who use Robinhood because of the Crayola aesthetic. You pcmasterrace types will be especially happy that your $4,000 toy will be finally getting used for something other than games that can be played on the Nintendo Switch. \r\n\r\nStep 2: Sort by “Gainers”, and look for companies in the $10-$100 range per share. Now, normally the little monkey in your head would be clapping at full speed making you want to throw your hard earned tendies at green numbers. Well slow down those two brain cells for a second, grab your fidget cube, and listen up for the next steps.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Pick some stock that has gone up 10% or more in just a day. Picture this: thousands of mongoloids steeped in FOMO are chasing the tendie train like rocket powered lemmings with iPhones (androids if you haven’t had sex before). They are blasting that share price to the moon and now is your chance.\r\n\r\nStep 4: Google “straddle strategy stocks”. We all know you’ll just image search because who has the time to understand where your thousands of dollars are going? Time is tendies.\r\n\r\nStep 5: Straddle that big retard stock you found earlier. Either: 1 it keeps going way up because the stock is still gathering retards like a re-release if szechuan sauce, 2 it goes way down as money is moved from the pockets of the retards to the pockets of the very richest people in the US, or 3 it doesn’t move much (not likely considering the current market autism density). Can’t go tits up.\r\n\r\nStep 6: Gain 3-10% and then sell. Put down your phone and go find that porn video you always go to. You deserve it! Small gains like this over time will print more tendies than trying to get lucky on a 889272927% gain on mattresses or whatever you retards are telling yourselves. \r\n\r\nTL;DR: buy naked calls \r\n\r\nPositions: Doggy Style"
