### Top count in Jupyter notebook: atoti vs pandas + matplotlib

2 notebooks are created for this comparison purpose:
- [atoti.ipynb](atoti.ipynb)
- [pandas.ipynb](pandas.ipynb)


__Note on data:__
These notebooks uses the [Google Play Store Apps data](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) from Kaggle. Data has been processed to convert strings with millions and thousands abbreviations into numeric data.

__Testing criteria:__ 
Given different categories of items, we will explore how to achieve the following in the two notebooks:
- Visualize top 10 apps with the highest rating in table
- Visualize top 10 categories with most number of apps rated 5 in Pie chart
- Visualize top 10 apps for each category in subplots
